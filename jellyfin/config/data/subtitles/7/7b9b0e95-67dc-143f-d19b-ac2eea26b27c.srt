1
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:53,908
This is not exactly the start,
but end of the story.

2
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:56,825
Japan, where the sun rises first on the earth

3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,866
This is a Japanese wedding…

4
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:08,658
Rich Japanese peope celebrate weddings this way.
Bride gives a costly gift to her groom in thier traditon.

5
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:22,866
The story I'm telling you is not about
Japanese wedding or their customs

6
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:27,158
Hero of this story is that Japanese instrument
that looks like a guitar.

7
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:33,283
It's so costly as is made of a special wood.

8
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:38,283
You will not find this wood anywhere around here.

9
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:46,366
But, it must be smuggled from China by sea.

10
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:52,700
Shanghai port, China.

11
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:58,575
That wood was transported by this ship to China,
because this wood is not available even in China.

12
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,700
It came here from Madras travelling thousands of miles.

13
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:21,950
They were loaded onto ships by these trucks.
You might be thinking so much hard work for this wood.

14
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,158
The place in the world where we can find red sandalwood...

15
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:33,283
is just Seshachalam forests.

16
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:39,450
It is illegal to cut down trees here as per law.

17
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:43,241
But crime exists where there is law.

18
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,991
Our story and red sandalwood smuggling
starts from here.

19
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,866
You are escaping from police?
Hey you!

20
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,575
Come out! Come out!

21
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:12,408
We have met after long time.
How are you?

22
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,408
Hope you are doing good.

23
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:18,283
That’s ok.

24
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,783
Why are you troubling me?

25
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,241
Let's settle it in Ten thousand.
Let's both be happy!

26
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:25,908
What do you say?

27
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:31,200
Bribe? Are you trying to bribe Police? You!

28
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:35,700
Sir, he wants to settle it in ten thousand.

29
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:46,033
Twenty Thousand!

30
00:04:59,033 --> 00:04:59,908
Thirty thousand!

31
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,366
-Forty thousand!
-You!

32
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,283
Fifty thousand!

33
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:31,491
Is even Fifty thousand less?

34
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:52,491
One Lakh!

35
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:04,200
You think one lack for you all?

36
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:07,116
What I’m saying is one lakh per head.

37
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,866
Brother… where are you from?

38
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,408
What is your name?

39
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,866
Pushpa!

40
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,033
Don't remember my name.

41
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:13,991
Don’t stay there gossiping
on the name of sipping tea.

42
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,825
Come fast. We have lots of work. OK?

43
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:41,283
Who is he? Is he your Son in law.. sitting like
owner. Labourers are too egoistic these days.

44
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:50,116
Who is that guy? Sitting cross legged?

45
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:52,325
Hey…what is this?

46
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,408
How can you sit cross legged,
Owner is angry.

47
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,700
Show some respect.

48
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,491
What?

49
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:04,158
This leg is mine and this leg is mine..
What's your problem?

50
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,825
Ask him to check the work and not the legs.

51
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,616
Does he pay me to work or give him respect?

52
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:12,366
You must change your behaviour
if you want to work here.

53
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,283
You cant behave as you want

54
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:15,575
Is it so?

55
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:19,325
It’s Not possible for me to change
so how about changing the job

56
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:21,741
Come on, settle my account

57
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,241
This is enough for what I have done.

58
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:35,200
Give this to your owner and ask him
to go and buy manners from the market.

59
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:38,533
Take this!

60
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:45,450
This ego will either make him rule
the world or go to dogs, one day.

61
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:49,158
Hey… Why are you following him?

62
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:52,033
I’m also changing the owner.

63
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,866
His words won my heart.
-You have no brains, what'll you do?

64
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:14,158
Didn’t I tell you that
I will pay back next month?

65
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:18,116
You are postponing every month saying next month.
How many times should I come to your house?

66
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:22,991
How are you living with no money in hand?
You are shameless being insulted every day.

67
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:25,825
Reddappa. Don’t say shameless.
Is this how you speak to a lady?

68
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:28,241
They should feel ashamed, madam.

69
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:30,700
She is a widow. Show some mercy.

70
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,658
What shall I do, if she is a widow?

71
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,075
She has a son as grown up like a donkey, right.

72
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:35,158
He is strong enough. Ask him to repay my loan.

73
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,658
Reddy sir, my son took up a new job.

74
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:39,325
-He will pay.
-What work?

75
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:40,366
Are you dreaming?

76
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:42,950
He let go all the works.
Ask him.

77
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,325
What Pushpa, is he saying the truth?

78
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,616
Have you really left work at the mill?
I am talking to you.

79
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,450
How can we meet the expenses?

80
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:56,033
Listen Parvati,
I will come tomorrow morning.

81
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,658
I want you to reapy every penny ,

82
00:09:57,658 --> 00:09:59,283
Oherwise, remember!

83
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:01,533
I'll insult you in front of the whole village.

84
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,366
Drink… Neither son is listening nor the buffalo.

85
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:13,825
Principle Three thousand and
Interest Three thousand six hundred.

86
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,533
Total Six thousand six hundred.

87
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:16,741
The account is settled, Pushpa.

88
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,825
Glad that your account is settled.
How about mine?

89
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:21,158
What account, idiot?

90
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:24,491
You insulted in front of e
when loan was taken.

91
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:26,825
Now , Shouldn’t you praise when repaid?

92
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,075
Is it?

93
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:30,866
Hello Ganesh, Suresh! Pushpa has repaid
his loan and it is settled.

94
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,700
Ok I take leave now

95
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,783
Is that crowd from yesterday, here now?

96
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:37,241
Who will go to their houses?

97
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:38,283
What do you mean?

98
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,783
Ganesh, get me the list of
Who all were there yesterday?

99
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,116
A total of 120 people were there.

100
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,366
Amar Teja

101
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:45,616
Chalapathi

102
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:46,783
Chenamma!

103
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:47,616
hey.. Stop.

104
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:49,408
Do you expect me to visit all their homes?

105
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:50,783
-Are you mad?
-You got to go.

106
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,658
Rayudu uncle!

107
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:59,783
Listen Rayudu… Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

108
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,616
Has he repaid?
-Yes. He has repaid the entire loan

109
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:04,033
-Subbalakshmi, Gayatri!
-Tell, rascal!

110
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,783
Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.
He is a good boy.

111
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:10,158
Pushpa... Inform Champa aunt also.
She is leaving for Dubai in the evening.

112
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,450
Hundred rupees work…Thousand rupees work.

113
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:16,783
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

114
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:21,283
What is the differece between hundred
rupees work and thousand rupees work?

115
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,116
This is legal to do Hundred rupees work.

116
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,825
That is illegal to do thousand rupees work.

117
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:27,200
Police may arrest you any time.

118
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,700
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

119
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:31,200
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

120
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:36,408
Thousand rupees work…Thousand rupees work.

121
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:41,075
Hey bro, where are you going? That’s an illegal work.
There is no guarantee to return home in that.

122
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,700
No tension, man. I too am aware of the law.
None belongs to us.

123
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:51,366
Hey ... please let our parents know we're
dead if I don't return in the evening.

124
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:16,658
Hey, get down quickly.

125
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:21,158
Move on... move on...

126
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:24,700
Move... move...

127
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:26,283
Get down!

128
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,158
Bro, Is this your first time ?
-Yeah bro.

129
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:42,033
What's your name?

130
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,741
Can they pay us after the work is done?

131
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:48,450
If the rain continues like this
We will take 10 days to reach our destination

132
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,408
Be careful.
Water is flowing with force.

133
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,825
Where are you all going?
You're an insult for being the labourers.

134
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:55,283
We put in so much effort to flick this,
and you want to hand over it to the police just like that?

135
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,491
I have an idea.
We shall all have a benefit.

136
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,658
Taskforce DSP Govind!

137
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:09,491
He's nightmare for Red sandal smugglers

138
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:13,200
After he took charge,
coolies realised that life more important than money

139
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,908
If anyone has to cut the trees or smuggle the goods out of
the forest it can be only after he takes a nap.

140
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,241
Ey.. What are you people doing here?

141
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:31,533
We came to graze the sheep... sheep

142
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,783
Where are the sheep then?

143
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,908
Sheep have gone into the forest to graze…

144
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:38,783
How many sheep are you grazing?

145
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,616
We didn't count, sir.

146
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:43,575
Around one hundred I guess.

147
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,783
We will have two hundred sir.

148
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,741
What work does Shepherds have with the axe?

149
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:56,783
They came to graze the sheep
and I came to kill the tiger if it comes...

150
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:00,950
Hey… Is this the way to speak to DSP sir?

151
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,991
Don’t you have respect??

152
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:06,075
Of course, we have respect, that’s why we hid the logs.

153
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:09,700
Otherwise, we would have moved them out
of the forest in front of you.

154
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:13,200
Then you would have really lost respect?

155
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,075
Hey what are you staring at?

156
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:19,658
Tiger is caught. Wrap it!

157
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:22,783
Don’t act smart? Where are goods?

158
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:24,908
Where are goods?

159
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,741
I thought you are man who came to catch the goods

160
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,491
Didn't know you came to catch whatever come in your way.

161
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:44,033
Hello Sir.

162
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,908
You can shoot one bullet at a time.

163
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,741
I can throw sixty axes at once.

164
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,741
We will OUTNUMER you.

165
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:57,325
Sir, Look at their faces. They are all looking like rouges.

166
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:58,866
Not now.
I beg you.

167
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:01,575
I too am requesting you.

168
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:04,033
If you listen to him, it will do good for all of us.

169
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:09,200
This is their place and can do anything here.
Let's take care of them later, please sir.

170
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:14,200
Please don't mess with them.

171
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,991
-Hey!
-Let's go sir, please.

172
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,033
Leaf lives on Sunlight to grow

173
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:24,408
The Goat eats away leaves to be alive

174
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:28,825
And a tiger hunts goat to survive

175
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,950
Isn’t it the power of Hunger?

176
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:33,158
Isn’t it the power of Hunger?

177
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,866
The tiger perishes in death
the death dissolves in time

178
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:46,408
And the time surrenders before Kali
This is a great hunger

179
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:55,450
The hunted knows it should run faster
And the hunter knows he should outrun his prey

180
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,533
If the hunted wins, it will live another day
And the hunter knows, it should win to survive

181
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:07,241
Life for one
May mean death for another

182
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:12,241
Goat has to find a place to hide
if it doesn’t want to be the next lunch of the tiger

183
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:42,575
A Worm is a bait to catch fish
Grains are used to trap the bird

184
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,325
A bone can lure the dog into danger
Survival is the hook for human beings

185
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:55,908
In the festival to please Goddess Kali
Animals gets sacrificed

186
00:18:56,158 --> 00:19:00,408
The knife gets smeared with blood
And even a goddess can’t escape from a bait

187
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:02,616
This is the fate of the world

188
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:15,200
If you are not alert, the bait will catch you
You can only survive if you have a hunger to gobble the bait

189
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:24,116
A hungry man can’t see right or wrong
Only the fittest will survive here

190
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:29,783
Goat has to find a place to hide
if it doesn’t want to be the next lunch of the tiger

191
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,283
Twenty one Kgs

192
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,616
Okay bro.

193
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,075
I said, right? Come on, move!

194
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,533
Go...

195
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:06,908
25 KG
-Take what I paid for. and leave.

196
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:16,825
Brother. I need to tell you something.

197
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,575
What?

198
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:20,116
I will be with you brother.

199
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:23,241
What do I have with me, except this beedi.

200
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:25,366
What's your name?

201
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:26,908
My real name is Kesava.

202
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:28,408
They call me Cutlet.

203
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,991
Since I don’t have one finger,
everyone calls me Cutlet.

204
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:32,408
What is the matter?

205
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:35,283
Brother, owners at the previous
place you worked told me.

206
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:39,241
He said that you will become a great man.

207
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:44,325
I somehow want to earn lot of money
and go back to my village.

208
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,616
I think I can earn if I’m with you.

209
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:52,533
What ? so you want me to become
a great man for your sake.. uh?

210
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:55,408
Please, for my sake.
This is my wish.

211
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,950
How much do you want to earn?

212
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:01,366
Ten Lakhs

213
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:05,908
That's it?

214
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:09,908
Ok, go fetch my wages for the day

215
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:11,325
Okay Brother.

216
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:14,491
Hey, Didn’t you collect your money already?
Why did you come again?

217
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,241
Not for me. I came for Pushpa’s wages.

218
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:18,658
From today onwards he's my friend.

219
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:20,491
Pushpa? Who is he?

220
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:28,116
There.. that guy sitting cross legged under
the tree, and smoking a beedi.

221
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:32,575
He is a coolie and not a Lord.
Ask him to come and take.

222
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,741
He could be sitting under a tree today,
If he gets a chance, he will be Prime Minister.

223
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,491
Remember that.

224
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:41,450
Stop your nonsense and leave.
-Stop!

225
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:48,200
Hey, what did you say?

226
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:52,575
You have sixty axes. Look here now.
There's an entire army here.

227
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:55,950
No one will survive even if one person moves.
Is the account settled now?

228
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,075
Everyone will be shot dead.

229
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:08,741
Hey, throw

230
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:10,908
Come on... throw.

231
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:13,325
Hey, they coming closer... throw it.

232
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:29,450
Run.. run... run...

233
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,366
You pushed everyone into a trouble
by throwing a stone at him.

234
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:33,991
Everyone is having to run now.

235
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,616
Stop it… Stop

236
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:45,158
Where is the Lorry?

237
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,658
What sir?

238
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,116
Don't you have any other job than to catch me?
Didn't you get the goods?

239
00:23:52,116 --> 00:23:56,325
Lets go to the station and talk..
It's hot here.

240
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:01,075
I won’t move my leg.
Sit, if you wish to.

241
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,866
Drinking Water…

242
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:35,658
Not for me Sir.

243
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:37,450
Give it to him.

244
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,991
He is so tired of beating me.
Poor guy.

245
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:43,325
Drink Sir.

246
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,908
Where did you hide the goods tell now…?

247
00:24:49,116 --> 00:24:52,616
My boss won’t spare me if I tell you.

248
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,241
Who is that?

249
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:58,408
Who else? It’s me.

250
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:02,575
No one is born in this district who can tell me..

251
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,200
No one can!

252
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,241
you call yourself Boss.

253
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,366
And you are laughing?

254
00:25:12,616 --> 00:25:13,533
Laughing…

255
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:16,325
You have no respect for Police…

256
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:17,616
laugh...

257
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,991
Are you the boss?
Stop it!

258
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:24,325
I know how to stop his laugh Sir.

259
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,783
What is your name boy?

260
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:38,325
We need to file the case, right?

261
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,450
Pushpa!

262
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,366
What’s your full name?

263
00:25:47,783 --> 00:25:48,658
Pushpa…

264
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,450
Pushparaj…

265
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,533
Then what’s your Surname?

266
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:56,700
Don’t know father's name?

267
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:06,825
One that is written in front of the name.
I’m asking what is it?

268
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:08,825
Don’t know?

269
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:11,366
Your father's name?

270
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,075
We all know it.
Don’t you know?

271
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:16,866
Why are you silent?

272
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:19,658
Why are you not talking?

273
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:31,075
Which family are you from?

274
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,158
Tell

275
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:37,158
Silence!

276
00:26:38,283 --> 00:26:39,491
Boy... What is your name?

277
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,158
Pushparaj

278
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,491
Pushparaj

279
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:43,533
Whose family?

280
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:44,491
Molleti…

281
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:47,783
Molleti…
-Molleti Pushparaj

282
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:48,783
What is your father’s name?

283
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,658
Molleti Venkata raman...

284
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,783
What is this sir?

285
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:02,616
Will you just write whatever anyone says?

286
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:05,116
Won’t you verify the details?

287
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:12,366
Just because my father visited their house
few times, will our surname become theirs?

288
00:27:17,908 --> 00:27:22,491
Can’t you differentiate kids born out of wedlock
and the ones born to a mistress?

289
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:26,575
Surname belongs to the ones born legally...

290
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,616
not to hybrid fellows.

291
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,700
Rey... Come here.

292
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,325
What is your name?

293
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:43,783
Molleti Pushparaj!

294
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,075
My father showed pity on your mother's poverty.

295
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:50,991
So, never forget who you are.

296
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,158
You don’t have any surname.

297
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,658
Your name is Just Pushparaj.

298
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,616
Understood?

299
00:28:04,158 --> 00:28:05,325
Now say, what is your name?

300
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:07,575
Pushparaj!

301
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:10,116
Pushparaj!

302
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:11,700
Say loudly so that everyone can hear.

303
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,116
Pushparaj!

304
00:28:35,658 --> 00:28:38,741
What is this brother?
They have beaten you so badly

305
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,991
Won’t they beat to get the facts?

306
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:44,366
Am feeling hungry.
Let’s talk while eating

307
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:46,408
What is this?
You get salary from his taxes.

308
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:47,866
Hey, be quiet.

309
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,408
Go man…

310
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:51,866
Brother, give something fast to eat.

311
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,991
Subbanna…
Jakkareddy bro, jaalreddy bro are coming

312
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,783
These are red sandal smugglers…
Brothers of Konda Reddy.

313
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:01,991
Konda Reddy brothers are three.

314
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,158
Third one is Jaali Reddy

315
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:07,950
Unless he feels the feminine air,
he will not be able to breath.

316
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:11,366
His nights don't end without a girl
on his bed.

317
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:17,325
It doesn't matter whom the girl marries,
she has to spent her first night with Jaali reddy.

318
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:19,908
Gift him Rs 10000

319
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:23,616
Brother has gifted 10000 rupees for the marriage.

320
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:27,825
Second one Jakka Reddy…

321
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,491
Amongst the three he's the one with brains.

322
00:29:30,825 --> 00:29:38,366
He takes care of the whole business.

323
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,991
He is Kondareddy, the eldest brother.
Local goon.

324
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:51,866
In the local riots,
he chased six of them and slayed them.

325
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:55,366
Believes in only Revenge over life
so threw a bomb at them.

326
00:29:55,658 --> 00:29:59,325
As a sole survivor of the gang,
he runs the show now with just the left hand.

327
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:02,866
When police caught bro, I thought none
would come to get him out...

328
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:05,450
but now I see the owners themselves have turned up.

329
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,158
Now I understand Pushupa bro is a great man.

330
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:09,491
Hope all is well…

331
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,200
Iam fine but..

332
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:13,658
Heard that you didn’t tell them whose goods
they are, even after police torturing you badly.

333
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:15,575
Looks like you have a lot of spunk.

334
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:17,075
Bro…

335
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,075
They hardly earn 60K in a year, bro.

336
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:22,033
What will I get if I tell them?

337
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:25,825
A broken beedi .. but you are different…

338
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,700
Are you asking money to tell where it is…
Coolie fellow…

339
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:30,866
Shut up!

340
00:30:32,158 --> 00:30:33,450
How much do you want?

341
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:35,866
You can’t give me what I want.

342
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,658
just, give me five lakhs

343
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:40,116
Five lakhs!

344
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:43,366
Who will give him 5 lakhs?

345
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,200
If we give him some nice thrashing,
he will reveal everything..

346
00:30:47,283 --> 00:30:48,241
What is that laugh?

347
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:50,408
This guy was laughing like this the whole night

348
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:54,283
40 Laathis broke, but the laugh didn’t go away..

349
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:57,241
finally we got fed up and stopped.

350
00:30:57,408 --> 00:30:58,866
My thrashing will be different.

351
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:03,075
Jaali, he's stubborn and looks trust worthy.

352
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:04,866
Okay!

353
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,700
I will pay the money you want.
Tell me where the goods are

354
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:12,866
You won’t understand if I say, let me show you…

355
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:19,450
See.. my hands are cuffed..
How can I show like this..?

356
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,533
He is asking us get him a bail..
Did you get it?

357
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:25,366
Looks like your brother is smarter than you...

358
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:28,700
anyways pay for what I ate and call a lawyer.

359
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:29,783
Hey Jaali

360
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:32,325
Are you telling us, just because we are not doing anything.

361
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,158
Do you know who are you speaking to?

362
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Konda Reddy Brothers.

363
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:37,200
I will kill you and burry you.

364
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:42,158
Then who will tell you where the goods are
Konda Reddy Brother?

365
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:54,616
What is this? It's all open fields here.

366
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,866
Where did he hide the truck here?

367
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,908
Looks like he may break the door.
Go and open the door

368
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,866
Brother, door is struck.
It’s not opening….

369
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:02,200
What’s the hurry?

370
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:04,575
Oh, this is a sliding door!

371
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,825
Get it repaired, it is tight.
-Move, idiot!

372
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:21,408
Where is the lorry, Bro?
Did it fall in the well by mistake?

373
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:48,533
What is this? You drowned the entire
lorry along with the wood?

374
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:53,741
Bro, give us the money, our money

375
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:55,200
Hey, give them the money.

376
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,575
Here is 5 lakhs…

377
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,491
go and enjoy with your brother.
have fun…

378
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:04,116
Never seen so much money bro…

379
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:07,033
Can repay all debts and
bring the buffalo back home.

380
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:09,283
Whoever had said it, said it right.

381
00:33:09,283 --> 00:33:11,491
‘if I am with you, I can make lot of money.

382
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,783
Hey Where are you coming?

383
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,533
I don’t have the habit of sticking to the women once I use her.

384
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:23,491
Take this twenty and come in an Auto Rickshaw

385
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,241
Come bro. There's the ride costlier than this.

386
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,075
Hey will you come? Will you break the glass or what?

387
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:34,866
What will be the price of that vehicle?

388
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:36,783
You mean, that Car…bro?

389
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:37,450
Ya…

390
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,575
It should be around 5 lacs bro

391
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:40,533
Does that car cost 5 lacs!

392
00:33:41,408 --> 00:33:42,575
Isn’t it too expensive.

393
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:43,283
Yes

394
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:46,700
Go and buy that car.

395
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:48,450
Bro...

396
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,908
Go and buy that red colour car.

397
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:53,866
What are you talking bro?

398
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:58,033
We came here in a car when we didn’t have a penny on us.

399
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:00,616
Would it look good to go by walk when we have so much money?

400
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:02,366
Go and get that car

401
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:06,283
Brother, please understand. If we buy the car,
all the money will be spending on the car.

402
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:07,741
We will be poor again.

403
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:09,325
Then we will have to go and work for daily wages again.

404
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:11,200
And will we go for daily wage work in a car or what?

405
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:16,616
Keshav, I came here in car,
and I will leave only in a car from here.

406
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:18,991
Till then I won’t move from here.

407
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:20,116
Listen to me Bro…

408
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,366
Hey… I will not budge an inch in prestige matter.

409
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,783
Hey. Who is that honking?

410
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:34,450
Do you think your mother owns this road?

411
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,533
Roll down the window.

412
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,075
I want to see who the hell you are...

413
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:40,408
It’s me. Your son from the hell…

414
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:43,700
Oh, is that you… Pushpa

415
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:46,116
What are those injuries on your body?

416
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:51,283
You are seeing the small, small injuries on my body,
but can’t see the big car in front of you.

417
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,908
What kind of work are you doing..?
Whose car is this?

418
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:58,325
It is Parvathidevi

419
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:00,158
Which Parvathidevi?

420
00:35:00,658 --> 00:35:02,075
Pushpa’s mother.

421
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:03,866
That’s me.

422
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:05,908
Then, It’s your car.

423
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:09,908
But, I can’t understand how you bought this car.

424
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,491
Seeing your difficulty in fetching water,
Brother bought this car for you.

425
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:15,116
Who the hell are you?
-Keshava Aunty.

426
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,575
Pushpa, why did you bring it here?

427
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:25,366
Whose car is this Maa?

428
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:26,783
Why is he doing circles?

429
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,033
Leave me, mom!

430
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,158
Uncle?

431
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:41,866
Daddy.. Uncle has bought the car

432
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:47,950
The one who buys a car becomes car owner… not your uncle.
Go, get back into the house.

433
00:35:48,075 --> 00:35:48,866
Come in

434
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:53,908
Did you see that car, Mohan?
Where did he get so much money to buy?

435
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:58,658
What else can you expect from a ragpicker?
Obviously through stealth.

436
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:03,283
Hey looks like Mangal Seenu Brother
has come. Go and see.

437
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:05,533
Brother, Namasthe…

438
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:06,700
Namasthe, Namasthe

439
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,741
Bro, just by spending five lakhs,
I am not only got a car, am also getting respect with it.

440
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:15,825
why are you staring like that, man?
Jakkareddy bro called us. So we came in our car.

441
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:22,450
Sit Bro… Now we are qualified to sit here.

442
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:26,450
don’t want, again have to stand up
when Konda Reddy comes.

443
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:28,450
I can’t give so much respect to him.

444
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
How many loads, Subbareddy?
- Around 10 tonees Brother

445
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:42,116
How could you guys go and surrender
5 crores worth of stock to Police?

446
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,950
Don’t we have anyone who can transport
the load by hoodwinking Govindappa?

447
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:48,241
He is catching us in whichever way we go.

448
00:36:48,658 --> 00:36:52,408
It is not possible to send a load when he is around.

449
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:55,658
You can't say song is bad when you can't dance.

450
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,158
Why are you giving so much weight for Govind?

451
00:36:58,158 --> 00:36:59,491
Say you could not do.

452
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:00,908
Who the hell is he?

453
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:02,325
He is a coolie fellow.

454
00:37:02,741 --> 00:37:07,616
What the hell, Just because you came in a car
you think you earned a right to speak in this meeting.

455
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:08,408
Get out…

456
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:12,991
Brother, he is the same guy whom we got out on bail, Pushpa.

457
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,158
I only asked him to come along.

458
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:17,741
Are you the one who hid our load
and collected five lacs from us?

459
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:22,825
Five lakhs are not for hiding the load Sir.
It’s for protecting you and your brothers from going to jail.

460
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,825
As if you don’t know…

461
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:28,241
it is not a big deal to get beaten by Police.

462
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:31,616
Speak if you have guts to transport the load without getting caught.

463
00:37:31,825 --> 00:37:35,033
You need an idea for transporting the load.
Not guts… we need brains.

464
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:38,158
Yes brother.
what our people are doing is...

465
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:43,075
Covering the load with Tomatoes and potatoes.
They move the fruits, they see the load..

466
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:47,616
Forget Police, Our load can be found
even by a useless watchmen also.

467
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:52,241
We have to send the load but no one should know.
I have an idea. Should I tell?

468
00:37:53,158 --> 00:37:55,325
You want to tell us how to transport the load.

469
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:58,241
Everyone See, who has come to give us ideas.

470
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,200
Coolie fellow.

471
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:02,116
say what you think. Say.. say…

472
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:07,533
is this a pickle to share with the entire world? Ideas brother...
how can I say it Infront of everyone...?

473
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,825
you are asking, us only to go out..
how dare you?

474
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:13,325
wait Jaali.

475
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:20,950
Hey!..I better like what you say..
if not this kondareddy will deal with you differently.

476
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:23,616
All of you go out.

477
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:28,950
Hey stop..

478
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:31,866
check him..

479
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:34,325
what sir.. Looks like you are suspecting me.

480
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:38,450
After your thrashing, I have stopped all old businesses
and started milk business now.

481
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:42,158
Yes Sir, We have taken contract with sweet Shop

482
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:44,575
Yes Sir, there is milk only here sir.

483
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:48,200
we mixed water in the milk,
now don’t tell me you are going to arrest us for that also.

484
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,241
Let him go.

485
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,283
Give some sweet to Sir.
He anyways doesn't take bribe.

486
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,491
Where was he hiding all these days?

487
00:39:56,991 --> 00:40:00,700
Give him… Give him all the load and
you be around to supervise.

488
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,533
I can do the complete the work all alone.
Just tell me what you will pay me.

489
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:06,658
your rate only Pushpa.

490
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,658
We will pay you what we paid last time..
5 lakhs per load. Is it Ok?

491
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,866
Five lakhs is not okay.
Give me 4 percent.

492
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,241
4 percent would mean 4 lakhs.

493
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:19,075
You will lose one lakh.

494
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:22,450
You can keep that one lakh to yourself,
just pay my 4 percent.

495
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:27,491
What is this bro?

496
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,991
He was willing to pay 5 lakhs..
One lakh is our loss.

497
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:35,158
If we had taken five lakhs, we would have been their servants.

498
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:40,158
By taking 4 percent, won’t we become his partners.?

499
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:47,158
Now, I and Konda are on the same level.
We are equal and I shouldn’t bow down.

500
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,950
I often feel, you are like a jackal.

501
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:57,033
Hey, why is everyone looking at the sky like that?

502
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:58,158
Looking for the sparrows.

503
00:40:59,033 --> 00:40:59,658
What?

504
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:00,658
For Sparrows

505
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,825
But…Why?

506
00:41:02,116 --> 00:41:05,033
Bro… see that girl sitting there,
wearing a red saree?

507
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:05,908
That girl…

508
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:08,616
She says she won’t sell milk unless she hears a Sparrow.

509
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,533
With such a big work in hand,
what is this sparrow nonsense man?

510
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:13,033
Who is that mad girl?

511
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:14,783
It’s my daughter.

512
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:17,783
She doesn’t listen to anyone. Even mine.

513
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:21,866
I named her after my mother,
and she is just like her in everything

514
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,658
Srivalli, will you fill the tankers with milk today?

515
00:41:48,616 --> 00:41:52,950
You turn away both your eyes when I look at you

516
00:41:53,158 --> 00:41:57,450
And cover your glances with your eyelids

517
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,491
You stare at even an invisible god without blinking an eye

518
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:06,408
But you are ignoring me when i’m in front of your eyes

519
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:14,241
Your looks have been waiting for a glance
of you, Srivalli.

520
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:23,158
Your looks have been waiting for a glance
of you, Srivalli

521
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:36,783
What Sir? Why are you pawing with Lathis?
Its only milk, Sir!

522
00:42:37,283 --> 00:42:38,866
We are a reformed lot now.

523
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,741
There is nothing here sir.

524
00:42:52,033 --> 00:43:00,116
Me, who used to lead in everything
Is following you wherever you go now

525
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:09,033
Me, who never bent my head before anyone
Has bent my head to look at your anklet

526
00:43:09,825 --> 00:43:13,991
After having lived such a great life,
Am now making rounds of your house

527
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:18,450
And thought it's enough
even if you look at me for an instant

528
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,866
Did She see?
-No bro…

529
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:26,075
Did you see properly?

530
00:43:26,783 --> 00:43:29,241
I have seen brother.
She didn’t even see once.

531
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:33,366
I think you are very happy, right?

532
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:35,033
for what, bro?

533
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:36,450
because she didn’t see.

534
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:37,825
Why will I be happy bro?

535
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:44,783
No.. you are feeling happy, eating that peanut candy happily
and saying, she hasn’t looked even once.. I noticed it.

536
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:46,908
No bro, I’m feeling bad inside.

537
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:51,825
ok. She didn’t see.
What would you have lost if you had said, she saw once..

538
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:54,241
at lest I would have felt happy Isn’t it..?

539
00:43:54,783 --> 00:43:56,991
I didn’t get that idea bro. Sorry bro…

540
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:59,700
You won’t get that idea.
Why will you get any idea that makes me happy?

541
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:07,033
Your looks have been waiting for a glance
of you, Srivalli

542
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:15,950
Your looks have been waiting for a glance
of you, Srivalli

543
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:53,075
All Your friends are average looking
May be... That's why you look beautiful

544
00:44:53,575 --> 00:45:02,033
And when one becomes 16
It's not just you, any girl would look cute

545
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:07,075
When red sandal wears a saree
Even a stone would look like a princess

546
00:45:07,116 --> 00:45:10,866
And, when a seven stone earring is worn
Any girl would look beautiful

547
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:12,158
Bro...

548
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:13,741
Now loading is done. Shall we go?

549
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:15,408
Shall we go?

550
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:16,575
Yes, Bro.

551
00:45:16,866 --> 00:45:20,241
Is that all? Should we go?

552
00:45:21,158 --> 00:45:24,408
What else? Loading is done.
So, Let’s go. That’s it

553
00:45:25,366 --> 00:45:27,366
Do you find all this funny?

554
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:28,825
Why bro?

555
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:30,825
You know it and you are still asking

556
00:45:30,825 --> 00:45:32,366
I seriously don’t know brother.
I don’t know

557
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:36,116
You know I didn’t come for the load,
but came here for that girl.

558
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:38,200
You know it and you are still saying
that we should leave.

559
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,700
Ok.. lets leave then.. come..
-brother.. brother..

560
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,991
you can stay here as long as you want..
I will also stay with you.

561
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:48,616
I will stay… I will stay and you too stay with me,
and tell me if she is looking at me.

562
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Did she see ?

563
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:51,950
Yes, Brother

564
00:45:52,366 --> 00:45:56,075
She is looking at you only while washing the vessels.

565
00:45:56,075 --> 00:45:58,325
Is it true..?

566
00:45:59,116 --> 00:46:03,283
You are lying to make me happy, isn’t it?

567
00:46:04,325 --> 00:46:05,700
Yes Brother

568
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,616
How can you agree so fast man?

569
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:11,908
You could have let me feel happy for
some more time...

570
00:46:11,908 --> 00:46:15,450
I think it is better I go and
beg her to look at me instead of dealing with you

571
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,033
Bro, don’t do that brother
-I will go and beg her, to look at me

572
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:21,325
Please don’t do that brother.

573
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:23,366
I know, there is no use talking to you..

574
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:27,158
but for the last time,
tell me if she is looking at me or not

575
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:30,283
I don’t know what to say brother.

576
00:46:30,283 --> 00:46:31,616
I told you to tell me that she is looking at me…

577
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:40,366
Your looks have been waiting for a glance
of you, Srivalli

578
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:48,200
Your looks have been waiting for a glance
of you, Srivalli

579
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:21,575
Stop! Stop!

580
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,241
Have the sweet!
-Hello Sir!

581
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:32,783
What happened sir? It’s the usual milk.
Why are you checking today sir?

582
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:44,450
What is this? I can hear milk sound on the top
and the sound of the wood below.

583
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:47,158
Are you hiding any load underneath?

584
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:48,866
Catch him… Catch him

585
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,575

586
00:47:51,575 --> 00:47:54,200

587
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:58,783
Sir, please leave us sir...
we are just labour sir.

588
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:01,908
This is all because of Pushpa sir...
We did as Pushpa said.

589
00:48:01,908 --> 00:48:02,866
Please leave us sir.

590
00:48:03,158 --> 00:48:05,908
There is one condition if I want to leave you.

591
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,283
All these days you did as Pushpa said.

592
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,033
Now you must do as I say.

593
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:13,825
What?

594
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,658
Fifteen for Hundred...
Fifteen for Hundred...Fifteen for..

595
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:20,241
Hello Brother. Please stop.

How much do you have?
-We need six tickets

599
00:48:25,908 --> 00:48:29,658
For the kind of money you have,
you can watch poster and not the film. Please leave

600
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:33,075
What should we do? How can we see the movie?

Hey girls, you are the girls from the milk center. Am I right?
-Yes we are, So what?

Just wanted to check if you could got the tickets

603
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:40,658
How can we buy a ticket,
when they sell Fifteen rupees ticket for One hundred rupees?

604
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:43,741
It is the price one has to pay for big brothers movie..

605
00:48:43,783 --> 00:48:45,158
We are short by four hundred

Is that so, I will give you 1000 if you do a work for me

607
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:50,033
What is that? What should we do?

608
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:52,908
You have a friend named Srivalli, right?
-Yes, of course

609
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:54,700
Ask her to look at our Pushpa once

610
00:48:55,283 --> 00:48:57,825
Hey .. hey.. Srivalli...

611
00:48:57,991 --> 00:48:58,700

That guy.. Pushpa. can you look at him once?

613
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:01,283
Who is Pushpa?

614
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:02,450
The guy who keeps sitting at your milk center.
Do you remember?

615
00:49:02,491 --> 00:49:06,450
He sits cross legged with a dark guy next to him

616
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:08,866
Hey girl, his name is Keshava and it’s me

617
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:10,325
You stop man.

618
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:13,741
He looks good girl. Please look at him once.
- Can we then see the film?

619
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:17,700
So, if we have to watch chirajeevi,
then I have to look at him.. Ok.. Ok

620
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:19,033

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,825
Okay.. okay. She will.
- Yes

622
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:22,408
Ok. Take this

623
00:49:22,825 --> 00:49:25,200

Hey girl. One more thing..
- What?

627
00:49:35,783 --> 00:49:38,950
You said you will look at him just now.
Why don’t you smile at him too?

628
00:49:39,158 --> 00:49:41,116
What is this smile business? I wont smile

629
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:46,866
If you don’t smile...
- No... No. She will smile It’s only a smile.. right.?

630
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:51,325
Ask him to come the Temple tomorrow
- Smile... ask her not to forget the smile

631
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:58,491
Bro, the priest said that the girl will look at you if perform Abhishekam.
He said that girl will look at you today.

632
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,283
I don’t believe in all these

633
00:50:02,325 --> 00:50:05,950
Bro, look here.
Srivalli is coming. Our prayers worked

634
00:50:07,325 --> 00:50:10,575
So, what if she comes?
She doesn’t look at me. Come... Let’s go

635
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,658
Where do you want to go? Stay back brother.
Stay once bro. look there

636
00:50:12,825 --> 00:50:15,491
Look at Pushpa. He is so handsome

637
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:16,950
He is there, look at him once.

638
00:50:17,116 --> 00:50:19,491
She doesn’t look at me. It’s a waste
Let's go.

639
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:21,491
(Girls whispering)
I am looking but he is not looking at me.

640
00:50:21,575 --> 00:50:23,033
Stop bro. I had paid thousand rupees

641
00:50:23,075 --> 00:50:24,075
What?

642
00:50:24,116 --> 00:50:26,700
To the priest. Our money will go waste..

643
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:33,533
This is the last time. If she doesn’t look at me,
I won’t look at her ever again in my life..

644
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:36,283
Ok Bro. This is my last word.
Don;t look again after this.

645
00:50:41,158 --> 00:50:43,200
Look at him... see him.

646
00:50:44,158 --> 00:50:44,950
You wait!

647
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,241
Srivalli is looking at me

648
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:53,283
Smile at him

649
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,283
Smile!

650
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,075
Is she looking at you?
- yes

651
00:50:58,408 --> 00:51:00,408
Smile at him
- I’m smiling.

652
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:03,158
Hey.. She is smiling at me too

653
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:05,866
Did she smile or is she smiling.. ?

654
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,575
Hey see man. She is smiled at me

655
00:51:07,825 --> 00:51:09,450
That’s the power of Thousand rupees

656
00:51:09,991 --> 00:51:10,866
you also smile back..

657
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,116
Yes, I too smiled

658
00:51:13,158 --> 00:51:16,616
It’s enough for these faces. Let’s go now
They paid thousand rupees only. Let’s go

659
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,908
Now I understood.

660
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:26,116
She didn’t see me when I was looking at her.
And I didn’t see her when she was looking at me.

661
00:51:26,741 --> 00:51:30,741
When she caught me looking at her,
while she was looking at me.. she ran away feeling shy

662
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:31,450
Oh! Is it?

663
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:33,241
I know that she loves me

664
00:51:33,575 --> 00:51:35,200
That’s why I was behind her.

665
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,825
Come. Let’s go and speak to her once

666
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:40,366
Where do you want to go? Don’t forget who you are..
You can’t bend before her

667
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:42,325
We should take first step in these situations.

668
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:44,158
Don’t go brother
-You don’t know.

669
00:51:44,158 --> 00:51:45,616
You wait, man.

670
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:48,533
Hey Srivalli... Srivalli.

671
00:51:50,366 --> 00:51:51,991
Why were you smiling at me ?

672
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:54,950
do you like me?

673
00:51:56,075 --> 00:51:58,075
When did I like you?

674
00:51:58,075 --> 00:51:59,950
Then why were you smiling at me?

675
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,783
Wont I smile when I am paid..

676
00:52:02,325 --> 00:52:03,491
Money?
-Yes

677
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:04,408
What money?

678
00:52:04,408 --> 00:52:07,533
It seems you were feeling sad, because I was not looking at you

679
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,491
was I feeling Sad?

680
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:13,033
Yes, that’s why your friend Keshava gave me
1000 rupees to smile.

681
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,075
Did you smile for that?

682
00:52:16,158 --> 00:52:19,991
Whatever it is, We got to see Chiranjeevi movie.

683
00:52:20,616 --> 00:52:22,366
He dnaced great.

684
00:52:22,658 --> 00:52:26,366
After having soft drinks and Samosa
we are still left with two hundred rupees.

685
00:52:26,616 --> 00:52:30,866
Let me know where you would tomorrow.
I will come and smile at you for that..

686
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:33,950
Is this what thousand rupees prayer means?

687
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:36,741
Tell me where I can find you tomorrow...

688
00:52:36,908 --> 00:52:39,158
All my pride and ego has gone to dust..

689
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,741
Hey Keshava. You have destroyed me today.

690
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:44,533
Hey Keshava. Where are you?

691
00:52:45,325 --> 00:52:49,366
Oh no! he's coming...
I did all this for your happiness

692
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:51,741
Isn’t it disgusting to ask that girl to smile at me
by paying her for money?

693
00:52:51,783 --> 00:52:56,616
You denied me of the feeling of happiness,
that a girl loved me..

694
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:59,866
How can we stoop so low, to pay a girl and ask her to smile at me..

695
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:02,616
Am I like that? Am I like that Jaali Reddy?

696
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:03,408
No.. no.

697
00:53:04,991 --> 00:53:09,950
You have totally damaged my dignity.
Anyways, How much did you pay?

698
00:53:10,075 --> 00:53:14,700
Thousand
-Thousand... for a smile.

699
00:53:17,658 --> 00:53:22,700
Ok. Anyways since I have already become bad..
I will pay five thousand ask her to give me a kiss me

700
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:26,116
What are you saying bro?
- I will pay her five thousand. Ask her if she will kiss me

701
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:27,741
I never thought you can behave like this bro

702
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:30,575
I’m not like this bro. I’m a very good person

703
00:53:30,616 --> 00:53:33,700
but you have started this
and now you should take this to the end..

704
00:53:33,783 --> 00:53:34,616
what do you mean by end?

705
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,366
I don't know what is the end ?
Till end . That’s all

706
00:53:37,783 --> 00:53:38,533
Bro...

707
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,200
Go, bloody fat ass!

708
00:53:46,116 --> 00:53:47,741
Thousands tonnes of red sandalwood logs!

709
00:53:52,116 --> 00:53:56,366
Approximately two hundred crores!
and halting here instead of enroute Chennai..

710
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:03,366
Mangal Seenu keeps shuffling his hub.

711
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:09,116
It is possible that the stock would be in Kondareddy godowns.

712
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:22,991
If you tip us off the moment he lands new stuff,
do you know the reward?

713
00:54:23,533 --> 00:54:24,783
Fifty Lakh Rupees.

714
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:34,116
How are you Draccha?
- I’m good Uncle

715
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,283
Srinu? What brings you here?

716
00:54:40,783 --> 00:54:42,575
Excellent location Konda Reddy.

717
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,700
Godown is also nice.
No Police can trace it.

718
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:49,950
He is Mangal Seenu, boss of the smuggling syndicate!

719
00:54:50,575 --> 00:54:52,741
There are many who cut red sandalwood.

720
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:56,200
But there can only be one man
who can single-handedly

721
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:02,366
navigate the big stuff all through
the 15 checkpoints to the Chennai Port.

722
00:55:02,991 --> 00:55:05,700
That’s why he is the one who calls the shots.

723
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:09,408
Nobody can go against him and get away with it.
They are dead.

724
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:12,658
I see that you are shifting all the load into my godown.
What is the issue?

725
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:15,991
You know Gowrreddy right...
- Yes, I know.

726
00:55:16,658 --> 00:55:22,575
I dismissed him from job as
he was messing up the with stock books.

727
00:55:22,658 --> 00:55:25,575
How could you do that man?
What if he informs the police?

728
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:28,241
You'll have to face huge blows.

729
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:33,700
That’s why I brought all the stock to your godown konda reddy.

730
00:55:33,866 --> 00:55:37,741
We still have some time to take it to Chennai.
Please safeguard the stocks. I hope it’s safe

731
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:44,991
What are you talking dear? Did we bring the
stock directly here without trusting Kondareddy uncle?

732
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:46,825
But the problem is that stock is safeguarded by that Jaali Reddy.

733
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,241
And you know that womanizer Jaali reddy is
surrounded always by girls.

734
00:55:50,283 --> 00:55:53,866
If we trust and leave our stock with here,
it is like digging our own graves.

735
00:55:54,116 --> 00:56:00,741
You said it right. If Govindappa comes behind a girl,
the entire stock will go for a toss.

736
00:56:00,908 --> 00:56:04,116
Syndicate has trusted me and kept the stock with me

737
00:56:04,116 --> 00:56:05,241
You said it right dear...

738
00:56:05,283 --> 00:56:10,491
No need to worry. Now we have a sharp guy called Pushpa.
He is taking care of everything.

739
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:15,158
After he came, Police are not able to catch even
a stem, forget a log.. there he comes.. see

740
00:56:15,616 --> 00:56:19,033
You are saying he is new. Can we trust him?

741
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:02,450
I will tell in detail about him some other time Seenu

742
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:06,533
He doesn’t look like the one to be discussed another time.

743
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,408
Anyways, I have to go for a wedding.
I take your leave

744
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:13,950
Pushpa, Srinu bro’s stock will be with us for two days.
Take care of it..

745
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:16,408
Sure, Brother
- Brother, we are getting late. Come fast..

746
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:20,991
What did you do with Gowrreddy?
Are you ignoring him or what?

747
00:57:22,325 --> 00:57:26,325
Don’t look at sky always uncle,
look at the earth also sometimes.

748
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:29,866
We get trees from the there only..
wont you put manure to it..

749
00:57:36,825 --> 00:57:39,033
Brother, Look there once.

750
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:00,783
No...

751
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:06,991
He is like my younger brother.
I can’t see him die.

752
00:58:18,616 --> 00:58:22,700
Why does this Mogalesh do incomplete work always ?
Get me the gun...

753
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:25,616
Give me.

754
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:37,241
Why do we need this garbage in our backyard?
Throw it in the forest

755
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:38,908
Go and do that work.

756
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:50,200
Bro...

757
00:58:50,408 --> 00:58:52,950
What is this?
- cardamom bro.. For a good smell

758
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:55,533
I have.

759
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:59,033
Why delay? Where are the girls?

760
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:00,575
They are coming brother.

761
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:08,783
They are waiting... Go

762
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:11,325
Go... go.
Go and kiss him.

763
00:59:11,325 --> 00:59:13,825
I’m scared dear. What if he bites me?

764
00:59:13,825 --> 00:59:16,825
Why are you scared? He looks so handsome.

765
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:18,991
What is that meeting they are having there?

766
00:59:19,866 --> 00:59:20,700
I don’t know brother

767
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:24,908
Why delay girl? He is waiting since morning. Send her fast

768
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:28,616
What is your problem to give a small kiss?

769
00:59:28,616 --> 00:59:30,991
If you can’t.. I will go and give him. Tell me

770
00:59:30,991 --> 00:59:36,533
You wait, As If we can’t do that.
Bro Should I come and give you the kiss?

771
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:43,116
Who is that? Calling me brother and offering me a kiss.
Where did you find them?

772
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,075
Stop those discussions and send her fast

773
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:48,158
I am feeling scared
-Shut up and come.

774
00:59:48,866 --> 00:59:51,325
She is coming bro.. Why is the other one Coming?

775
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:55,158
He is asking for a small kiss.
Go and give him a kiss, go...

776
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:01,700
Keshava, close the door

777
01:00:01,866 --> 01:00:03,491
No, keep it open

778
01:00:04,325 --> 01:00:06,783
What are you doing here dirty fellow?

779
01:00:07,283 --> 01:00:10,866
I’m noticing you since long.
Why are you shouting? Stop those antics..

780
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:12,116
I will slap you hard idiot

781
01:00:12,158 --> 01:00:15,825
Do it fast Pushpa and let’s go. Girls, turn away.

782
01:00:17,116 --> 01:00:19,325
Don't worry, I'm agood guy.
- No touching!

783
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,616
Without touching!

784
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,325
What is that?

785
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,991
Cardamom...
do you want?

786
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,450
Not there. I will kiss you here

787
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:33,033
Here?
- Yes

788
01:00:33,116 --> 01:00:36,033
Why should we pay so much for a kiss here?
Hey Keshava

789
01:00:36,116 --> 01:00:38,200
Ok ok. Don’t make it an issue..

790
01:00:39,825 --> 01:00:40,866
Okay.

791
01:00:42,783 --> 01:00:43,533
Ok give me..

792
01:00:43,616 --> 01:00:45,158
Talk something.

793
01:00:45,158 --> 01:00:50,200
What is there to talk? You took money to kiss me.
Right.. so kiss me..

794
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,325
Why are you crying girl?.. why?

795
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:10,908
I thought it is easy when my friends told me.
But my heart isn’t agreeing.

796
01:01:11,325 --> 01:01:14,616
First kiss....

797
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:19,783
How will I understand if you murmur? Say it clearly

798
01:01:19,908 --> 01:01:23,450
I always wanted to give first kiss to my husband...

799
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:30,325
If you wanted to give it to your husband or someone,
why did you take money from me? Treat me as your hubby and kiss

800
01:01:30,408 --> 01:01:33,200
Or return the money. It is hard earned money.

801
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,575
Oh God, come out.

802
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,200
What have you done?

803
01:01:37,283 --> 01:01:38,116
What did you do brother?

804
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:42,075
I didn’t do anything brother. I didn’t even touch her
-What did you do? Why is the poor girl crying so much?

805
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:45,783
Ask Srivalli.
Hey Srivalli. Did I do anything to you?

806
01:01:46,116 --> 01:01:48,033
We trusted and sent our friend and is that what you do to her?

807
01:01:48,116 --> 01:01:49,241
Then, why did you take 5000?

808
01:01:49,325 --> 01:01:52,533
I didn’t do anything brother.
Tell them that I didn’t do anything

809
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:55,158
(Indistinct Voices)

810
01:01:56,783 --> 01:01:57,950
She is raising hand on to me, bro.

811
01:01:57,991 --> 01:01:59,783
She is making ruckus here.

812
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,033
Leave it bro. She said she will kiss her husband only right

813
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,033
It’s my kiss man. I paid for it.

814
01:02:06,658 --> 01:02:10,283
If I have to marry her and become her husband, I will.
I'll collect 5000 at any cost.

815
01:02:10,658 --> 01:02:12,866
I won’t compromise on this

816
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:24,325
Hey what is this? The entire stock is still here.

817
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:27,200
Didn’t I tell you that we must cross
the check post with this by the night?

818
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:29,491
Jali bro was partying the whole night.

819
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:33,866
He has stopped the lorries as they might disturb the party.

820
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:38,533
have your brains gone dead?
Who is Jaali to stop the stock the stock movement?

821
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:42,866
Police are observing us like Jackals for this
address since night,

822
01:02:42,866 --> 01:02:44,200
and you know how risky it is..

823
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:47,616
Where are the keys?

824
01:02:47,658 --> 01:02:50,116
That is Jali bro’s room.
He will kill if we give you the keys

825
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,616
Say, I opened without keys.

826
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,450
Pushpa, consequences will be bad.

827
01:03:14,116 --> 01:03:15,200
Hey Keshav, come here.

828
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:19,450
please ask our guys to drop her in the village safely.

829
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:20,200
Okay.

830
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,033
Go...

831
01:03:22,491 --> 01:03:24,950
Selva, take her and leave her in the village.

832
01:03:29,116 --> 01:03:31,075
Pushpa has sent the girl home

833
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,783
We are packing A grade stock into a different lorry

834
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:35,575
Why did you send the girl?

835
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:38,283
First tell me why you didn’t you send the stock.

836
01:03:38,283 --> 01:03:40,908
Have you converted the godown into brothel house?

837
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:45,116
Who are you to ask me? This is my godown
you are just a daily wages idiot

838
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:47,908
How dare you call me daily wage worker?

839
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,450
This is Pushpa.
Partner Pushpa. 4 Percent share.

840
01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:53,825
Give it now

841
01:03:54,033 --> 01:03:55,116
Speak to him brother

842
01:03:55,366 --> 01:03:57,783
Pushpa, Owner wants to speak to you

843
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:02,866
Don’t you use what you have above neck
instead of what you have below the waist?

844
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:05,658
Bro, please tell

845
01:04:06,116 --> 01:04:09,658
Police have come to know our godown address

846
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:13,075
What are you saying brother?

847
01:04:18,075 --> 01:04:19,533
Hope all the stock is cleared from the godown

848
01:04:19,575 --> 01:04:23,450
No brother. Your brother Jaali has
stopped all lorries from entering the godown

849
01:04:24,408 --> 01:04:29,450
My god! It is worth 200 crores.
We will be done forever if we are caught.

850
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:34,075
Srinu has trusted us and handed over the stock.

851
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:38,450
Somehow you take care

852
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:40,491
You have trusted me and handed over to me..

853
01:04:40,491 --> 01:04:42,866
consider Pushpa is dead, if even one log is caught..

854
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,950
How scared he is, the slave!

855
01:04:48,283 --> 01:04:50,783
Bro doesn’t budge an inch, always gives it back!

856
01:04:54,533 --> 01:04:56,908
How do we tackle this?

857
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,241
Okay bro.

858
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:19,283
Rey... Pick the stock and throw it in the stream.

859
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:25,033
What are you looking at? Police are coming.
Get up and move

860
01:06:42,116 --> 01:06:44,700
Brother, listen to me once.
250 crores worth of Goods.

861
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,200
Entire stock is being thrown into water here.

862
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,950
Mangal Srinu Stock is also there in that.

863
01:06:48,575 --> 01:06:52,408
We can put it on Pushpa if Police catches it.

864
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,950
Not good for you to be there now.
Leave from there immediately

865
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:55,700
This fellow Pushpa is caught now.
Srinu will not leave him.

866
01:08:55,741 --> 01:08:56,866
Well said, bro!

867
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:09,825
Police are here.

868
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,825
Brother... One log is here.

869
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:52,575
Make it fast, sir!

870
01:10:04,741 --> 01:10:05,825
Quickly.

871
01:10:22,783 --> 01:10:24,033
Come on... quick

872
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:41,158
Sir, They have put towers in the entire forest.
They would have known the information by now

873
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:47,991
Rey...Is stock there?
- Sir, nothing is there here.

874
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:51,325
If Pushpa is there stock will not be there.
If stock is there Pushpa won’t be there.

875
01:10:51,658 --> 01:10:55,116
If you want to see both together,
your wish can never be fulfilled.

876
01:10:56,283 --> 01:10:59,741
We should all be thankful to Govindappa Sir!

877
01:10:59,908 --> 01:11:02,575
Our range has grown because of this sir only...

878
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:06,450
If he had caught the stock that day,
I wouldn’t have become a partner today..

879
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:09,450
Don’t say like that brother? Sir may get angry

880
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,408
What sir? Are you getting angry??

881
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:16,950
Alas... I don’t even have shirt for you to hold my collar.

882
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:21,700
I have just donated itw.
Not just you sir, we also do good deeds

883
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:24,866
Rey... You are not understanding what you are doing...

884
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,075
You are more cruel than animals... Yak

885
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,783
What is crueler than this world sir?

886
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:35,450
This world has given a gun to your hand
and an axe to my hand.

887
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:37,616
Everyone has his own war to fight.

888
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:43,658
I have won this war also sir

889
01:11:44,575 --> 01:11:46,533
I will take care of whatever comes.

890
01:11:53,033 --> 01:11:55,825
Yes, You have won today.

891
01:11:57,408 --> 01:11:59,533
But do you know, you are palying a game to lose?

892
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:05,908
You will lose as much as you are winning today.
You will know as you age..

893
01:12:14,075 --> 01:12:16,825
Losers will always talk about principles.

894
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,075
When does the party start?

895
01:12:21,075 --> 01:12:25,075
Heard about Mangal Srinu party,
but first time I am seeing it.

896
01:12:25,283 --> 01:12:31,575
Not only smugglers but police,
politicians all have come to party.

897
01:12:31,575 --> 01:12:37,241
When one saw so much money
Pushpa has become hero instantly.

898
01:12:41,366 --> 01:12:44,866
They kill me with their looks if I wear a saree

899
01:12:45,116 --> 01:12:48,741
They scan me with their eyes if I wear a skirt

900
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:52,533
Forget saree and gown, what's in this dress?

901
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:56,366
Looks and mind are ugly, what can a woman wear?

902
01:12:56,366 --> 01:12:59,950
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

903
01:13:03,908 --> 01:13:07,491
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

904
01:13:11,366 --> 01:13:14,908
One is ready to die for my cute face

905
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:18,700
He teases the babe to come into the hug

906
01:13:18,866 --> 01:13:22,491
Forget fair and dark, let me reveal the true color

907
01:13:22,616 --> 01:13:26,283
A man never let's me wear a sari to cover my body

908
01:13:26,325 --> 01:13:29,908
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

909
01:13:33,825 --> 01:13:37,408
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

910
01:13:56,283 --> 01:13:59,741
One jumps with joy for the tall legged girl

911
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,575
He tries to trap the girls around him

912
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:07,408
Forget tall and short, he took over all with sweet words

913
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:11,366
Man doesn't care for anything in regards with a woman

914
01:14:11,491 --> 01:14:15,075
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

915
01:14:18,783 --> 01:14:22,366
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

916
01:14:26,325 --> 01:14:29,783
One feels happy If I'm stout

917
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:33,533
One feel bliss If I'm slender

918
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:37,450
Forget stout and slender

919
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:41,241
It is the man's wicked nature who caught me alone.

920
01:14:41,366 --> 01:14:44,950
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

921
01:14:48,866 --> 01:14:52,450
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

922
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:56,366
I have a very good heart says one person

923
01:14:56,616 --> 01:15:00,325
There is no good or bad, everyone belongs to the same race

924
01:15:00,325 --> 01:15:02,741
Yes or no!

925
01:15:07,658 --> 01:15:11,408
Yes or no!

926
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:15,033
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say Yes

927
01:15:18,866 --> 01:15:22,450
One person poses like a respected man...

928
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:26,283
I have a very good heart says one person

929
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:30,241
There is no good or bad, everyone belongs to the same race

930
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:32,658
when the lights are off...

931
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:41,325
when the lights are off... Everyone is the same.

932
01:15:41,366 --> 01:15:44,950
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say Yes

933
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:52,366
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

934
01:16:03,741 --> 01:16:07,866
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

935
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:14,241
Mangal Sreenu has arranged a super party
-Yes, great party bro!

936
01:16:14,491 --> 01:16:18,366
He will get 2 crores from us

937
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:22,575
and give only 25 lakhs to them.
He's fooling everyone in the syndicate.

938
01:16:30,533 --> 01:16:34,991
Brother, I want to speak to you urgently.
- What is that?

939
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:44,991
That Mangal srinu is cheating us bro.
Mangal srinu is fooling us.

940
01:16:45,325 --> 01:16:48,950
How much does he give us per ton?
Twenty-five lakhs right.

941
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:51,741
He is selling for Two crores outside..

942
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,075
How do you know?

943
01:16:56,033 --> 01:17:01,325
Nagesh heard them speaking on phone.
He's selling to some Murugan of Chennai.

944
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:06,366
Of late I was also getting doubt on him...

945
01:17:06,366 --> 01:17:11,283
He is buying lands in lot of places.
What do you say now?

946
01:17:11,533 --> 01:17:13,950
Nothing to say. Let’s go and ask

947
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:16,075
Why is he paying so less to us?

948
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:19,616
We are all working hard and he is sitting and
enjoying all the fruits. Ask him Brother

949
01:17:19,616 --> 01:17:22,283
What? you want to go and ask Mangal Srinu is it?

950
01:17:22,283 --> 01:17:24,700
Yes
-Do you know what he is?

951
01:17:24,783 --> 01:17:26,408
Hey Stop... You stop.

952
01:17:27,116 --> 01:17:33,325
You Can go and ask but there are lot of other things
between me and Srinu.

953
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:36,450
We will get into trouble if anything goes wrong.

954
01:17:37,325 --> 01:17:39,991
What is this? -Pickle, sir
-No need, go..

955
01:17:41,325 --> 01:17:42,908
Do one thing man.

956
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:47,783
You go and talk about increasing the rate.

957
01:17:47,908 --> 01:17:49,450
If he agrees,

958
01:17:50,283 --> 01:17:53,616
and accepts to what you ask,
then you get 50% share...

959
01:17:54,408 --> 01:17:58,158
else, you didn’t ask me anything.
There is no relationship between us.

960
01:17:59,283 --> 01:18:00,283
What do you say?

961
01:18:02,075 --> 01:18:07,283
No Brother. If anyone has to ask him, it is you brother.

962
01:18:07,491 --> 01:18:08,700
Fine, I'll look into it.

963
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,908
Hey old man, did you see Pushpa’s range.

964
01:18:13,241 --> 01:18:15,491
He is having lunch with Kondareddy.

965
01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:18,783
You said it right.He used to come to work for
a wage of hundred, and two hundred.

966
01:18:18,783 --> 01:18:20,408
Now he has become very big

967
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:24,658
Where will you get a better match
for your daughter than him.

968
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:25,866
Shall I talk to him?

969
01:18:26,491 --> 01:18:29,700
Why did my daughter's marriage
suddenly come into this discussion?

970
01:18:30,325 --> 01:18:32,700
How can I give my daughter
without knowing about his family?

971
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:34,491
Hello... Do you know who he is?

972
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:36,366
He is younger son of Molleti Venkata Raman.

973
01:18:36,491 --> 01:18:38,825
Is that so? Then he is our own.

974
01:18:39,325 --> 01:18:40,366
Good match

975
01:18:43,575 --> 01:18:45,366
Uncle, The groom family is here.

976
01:18:45,366 --> 01:18:46,116
Please come in.

977
01:18:46,241 --> 01:18:47,866
Namaste!

978
01:18:47,866 --> 01:18:50,366
See, How Muniratnam face is glowing

979
01:18:50,616 --> 01:18:53,616
Our lives are such that we feel happy
if Molleti Venkataramana says hi to us.

980
01:18:53,825 --> 01:18:57,158
A match with such family means…
Its all god grace

981
01:18:57,158 --> 01:18:57,783
Here!

982
01:18:59,866 --> 01:19:01,408
What are you looking at?
Move...

983
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:01,991
come in please.

984
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:03,658
Sit... please sit down.

985
01:19:03,783 --> 01:19:05,241
Hey, Bring Srivalli.

986
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,116
He is talking strangely

987
01:19:07,116 --> 01:19:08,491
What did you say?

988
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,616
That’s what Bro. I told him that you are
third son of Molleti Venkataraman.

989
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:12,991
Did you say like that?
-Yes!

990
01:19:13,325 --> 01:19:15,700
I’m somehow getting scared

991
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,241
What’s wrong? Did he not tell what the truth is..?

992
01:19:18,241 --> 01:19:19,783
Not like that my son
-Be silent Mom.

993
01:19:24,658 --> 01:19:26,366
Bro, sister in law is coming.

994
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:51,741
Look there Manju, how is he staring at her?

995
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:53,325
He really came down to marry.

996
01:19:54,741 --> 01:19:55,700
The girl is looking beautiful.

997
01:19:55,783 --> 01:19:56,908
Girl, I had told you earlier only.
It was just a small kiss.

998
01:19:56,908 --> 01:19:58,408
You should have given it to him.
See it has come up to marriage.

999
01:19:58,991 --> 01:20:02,325
Now you have to keep kissing him for life.
That too for free.

1000
01:20:07,283 --> 01:20:09,575
We should've laxatives in his juice.

1001
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,158
You...!

1002
01:20:13,658 --> 01:20:18,700
Taking Goddess Laxmi as witness,

1003
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,491
Rangampet resident...

1004
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:23,741
We check for the breed when we buy mangoes.

1005
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:29,366
Mango business is on here, but none knows
from which tree has that come.

1006
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:33,033
Venkataraman’s eldest son.

1007
01:20:33,866 --> 01:20:34,908
Greetings, Mohan Sir.

1008
01:20:35,325 --> 01:20:38,366
It is said that relationship means it has
to have 7 generations both sides

1009
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,533
Why is it that you are not looking
at even to one generation?

1010
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:43,658
Do you know to whom you are giving
your daughter for marriage?

1011
01:20:44,116 --> 01:20:45,241
What are saying sir?

1012
01:20:45,491 --> 01:20:47,575
He said he is the son of Molleti Venkata Raman sir.

1013
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:49,200
Isn’t he your younger brother?

1014
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:51,408
Will someone become king just because
he has Raja in his name?

1015
01:20:51,408 --> 01:20:53,366
Similarly, by taking my father's name

1016
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:55,408
some idiot cannot become my brother.

1017
01:20:55,783 --> 01:20:58,366
She is a lady shouldn’t she have any shame ?

1018
01:20:59,783 --> 01:21:02,741
Son, you sit quietly.
Swear on me that you won’t get up

1019
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,491
Hey, give it here.

1020
01:21:08,325 --> 01:21:13,991
Have you seen what is in that?
Did you see any surname? Where's father's name?

1021
01:21:13,991 --> 01:21:17,658
No Sir, its only written as Pushpa raj

1022
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,908
That’s the story.

1023
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:23,866
He has no surname and is
surviving by using our surname

1024
01:21:25,283 --> 01:21:27,700
So what if he doesn’t have surname,
what is it that Pushpa doesn’t have..?

1025
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:31,366
He has a house and earns handful.
Isn’t it enough to take care of your girl?

1026
01:21:31,616 --> 01:21:32,491
What do you say?

1027
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:33,533
You said it rightly

1028
01:21:33,533 --> 01:21:34,366
what will he take care?

1029
01:21:34,366 --> 01:21:36,533
Do you think wedding is some toy game?

1030
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:39,158
We get a girl married to change her surname.

1031
01:21:39,366 --> 01:21:42,033
Forget about surname, he doesn't even know the father.

1032
01:21:42,241 --> 01:21:43,033
Get up dear.

1033
01:21:43,033 --> 01:21:45,325
You wait... listen to me.

1034
01:21:45,325 --> 01:21:46,825
Leave her, leave.

1035
01:21:48,866 --> 01:21:52,200
Hey Son, you both are brothers and you share the same blood..

1036
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:56,783
when such good occasions are happening,
one should overlook and move on.

1037
01:21:57,658 --> 01:21:58,741
I agree with you

1038
01:21:59,033 --> 01:22:01,658
I agree that my father had an affair with his mother.

1039
01:22:01,658 --> 01:22:04,908
But what is the guarantee that he is born to my father?

1040
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,408
My father didn’t tell me.

1041
01:22:14,241 --> 01:22:15,241
What man?

1042
01:22:15,325 --> 01:22:17,658
Did your mother at least tell you to
whom you are born? What?

1043
01:22:17,658 --> 01:22:19,116
How dare you?

1044
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:26,408
(Commotion)

1045
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:31,700
(Commotion)

1046
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:34,658
Pushpa!
-Bro, Mother...

1047
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,283
Bro, Mother...

1048
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,616
Mom!

1049
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:48,866
Mom!

1050
01:22:51,825 --> 01:22:52,741
Mom!

1051
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:55,283
Keshava, get the vehicle.

1052
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:20,491
Throw her out!

1053
01:23:21,116 --> 01:23:23,741
Please leave me... Please

1054
01:23:23,783 --> 01:23:26,783
Please... let me see his face once.

1055
01:23:41,658 --> 01:23:44,658
Please... let me see his face once.

1056
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:07,450
when your father asked me weather I want love
or respect, then I thought love was enough.

1057
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:11,450
I thought life can be led with love.

1058
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:18,325
But I never thought you will face
so many insults because of this.

1059
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:30,200
Had I known it, I would have taken
some poison when you were in my womb.

1060
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:33,741
Mom!

1061
01:25:34,783 --> 01:25:36,575
Please forgive me, my son.

1062
01:25:36,783 --> 01:25:39,825
What is this maa? What are you talking?
What happened now?

1063
01:25:39,825 --> 01:25:43,491
You have injuries on your head
that’s why you are talking like this.. Sleep now.

1064
01:25:43,783 --> 01:25:45,616
Grandma... Please maker her sleep.

1065
01:25:45,825 --> 01:25:49,325
Don’t cry my dear.

1066
01:25:49,908 --> 01:25:50,991
Mom...

1067
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,033
Get some tea. Do you have money?
-I have bro.

1068
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:04,991
Bro...

1069
01:26:09,866 --> 01:26:14,408
I was just five-year-old then.

1070
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,325
I didn’t even know how to fight.

1071
01:26:21,116 --> 01:26:25,283
These guys have created all kinds of troubles
and took away whatever we had.

1072
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:44,741
My father had given me a gold chain for my birthday.

1073
01:26:45,866 --> 01:26:49,783
In that chain there used to be photo of me and my father.

1074
01:26:50,616 --> 01:26:54,658
That was the only thing I had as a memory in those things.

1075
01:26:56,616 --> 01:26:59,366
They took away that as well.

1076
01:27:05,408 --> 01:27:07,450
They took away everything that belonged to me.

1077
01:27:11,033 --> 01:27:15,741
I won’t keep silent if they try
to take away what I have to get..

1078
01:27:17,408 --> 01:27:20,533
Whether it is 10 paise or 10 crores.

1079
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:22,825
I won’t spare anyone.

1080
01:27:23,575 --> 01:27:26,533
I won’t spare anyone, even if its the Lord on
the hill or Mangal Srinu down the hill.

1081
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:30,283
I will collect everything with interest.

1082
01:27:32,866 --> 01:27:34,075
This is Pushpa

1083
01:27:34,575 --> 01:27:35,741
Pushparaj here.

1084
01:27:36,366 --> 01:27:38,450
I won’t compromise.

1085
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:42,658
Beat him here…not there

1086
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:43,825
I have already beaten him there bro.

1087
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,408
Beat him on his knee?

1088
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,450
On his knee’s bro?

1089
01:27:47,575 --> 01:27:51,241
That hand… Mouth...
Beat him on the mouth.

1090
01:27:51,241 --> 01:27:52,408
Idiot shouldn’t open his mouth again.

1091
01:27:52,408 --> 01:27:54,408
Bro… He is scared

1092
01:27:54,408 --> 01:27:55,658
That’s why I asked you to beat.

1093
01:27:56,075 --> 01:28:01,908
How dare he comes directly to me
and ask me to increase the rate?

1094
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:13,491
It seems, Twenty-five is not enough for him..
he wants fifty lakhs per ton.

1095
01:28:13,825 --> 01:28:15,908
Fifty… Do you want Fifty lakhs?

1096
01:28:15,908 --> 01:28:19,366
If I don’t give, you want to deal
with Chennai Murugan directly?

1097
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:24,533
Why can’t you beat him yourself?
You are sitting happily and ordering him?

1098
01:28:24,908 --> 01:28:28,408
Bro... Stop now.
Drink this and take a breath.

1099
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,741
Haven’t you got tired beating him since morning?

1100
01:28:31,158 --> 01:28:33,283
Unnecessary fuss all the time

1101
01:28:33,575 --> 01:28:35,533
Bro, MLAs phone!

1102
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:37,366
Hello MLA Sir.

1103
01:28:37,783 --> 01:28:39,616
Come Pushpa. Sit.

1104
01:28:39,908 --> 01:28:40,908
Yes. Tell me Sir

1105
01:28:40,908 --> 01:28:43,658
Hey Srinu. Heard that you kidnapped Nagesh.

1106
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:46,491
His brother came and is regretting
for the mistake that happened.

1107
01:28:47,283 --> 01:28:48,408
Leave him for this time.

1108
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:50,075
I will speak to you

1109
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,533
So sad... I just killed him.

1110
01:28:53,116 --> 01:28:53,908
Brother…

1111
01:28:54,908 --> 01:28:56,866
You should have called me five minutes ago.

1112
01:28:57,741 --> 01:29:01,741
I’m just washing the knife after cutting his neck
and your call came..

1113
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:04,366
I had called your PA also in the morning Sir.
He also didn’t say anything.

1114
01:29:04,533 --> 01:29:07,908
Hello Sir, please tell me in advance
if there is something like this next time.

1115
01:29:08,116 --> 01:29:09,450
It’s a matter of a person’s life. Isn’t it?

1116
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:11,783
I don’t want any differences
between you and me unnecessarily.

1117
01:29:11,783 --> 01:29:13,450
By the way, I sent the money.

1118
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,783
How are you Pushpa?
-I’m fine, Sister.

1119
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:18,825
Wjat to do with this idiot now?

1120
01:29:18,825 --> 01:29:20,116
Hey Nagesh.

1121
01:29:21,033 --> 01:29:26,408
I have given a word to the big man on the other side.
I will go wrong if I leave you.

1122
01:29:28,366 --> 01:29:30,741
Hey, Cut him into pieces.

1123
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:31,616
Okay.

1124
01:29:36,366 --> 01:29:39,491
You guys have spoilt the entire floor...

1125
01:29:39,491 --> 01:29:42,033
Make it clean.

1126
01:29:42,658 --> 01:29:44,825
What Pushpa? What made you come to me?

1127
01:29:44,825 --> 01:29:45,950
How is Reddy?

1128
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:46,700
He is fine Brother.

1129
01:29:47,116 --> 01:29:48,700
Brother, I have mixed the color.

1130
01:29:49,075 --> 01:29:50,283
What is this? Is this black?

1131
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:51,491
Yes, black brother.

1132
01:29:52,325 --> 01:29:54,533
Last time also you had said it was black
but had turned chocolate.

1133
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:57,491
It was so awkward in front of everyone

1134
01:29:57,575 --> 01:30:00,783
It just happened like that last time brother.
This time it will be black for sure.

1135
01:30:00,908 --> 01:30:04,783
I don’t have confidence in you.
Put on him and show.

1136
01:30:05,741 --> 01:30:06,950
apply on him.

1137
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:11,533
See Pushpa, how he died struggling.

1138
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,241
Else, he wanted Fifty lakhs per ton.

1139
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:18,616
All you have to do is to cross two check posts
and deliver stocks to me.

1140
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:22,950
I must cross fifteen check posts
to transport the stock to Chennai.

1141
01:30:22,991 --> 01:30:24,116
Can you imagine how difficult it is?

1142
01:30:24,241 --> 01:30:26,033
I agree brother, It is a very difficult job indeed.

1143
01:30:26,491 --> 01:30:29,741
Even I faced difficulty near fifteenth check post.

1144
01:30:29,908 --> 01:30:33,408
That SI Manikandan you know right.
He asked me for one lakh rupees.

1145
01:30:33,533 --> 01:30:34,741
That fellow.

1146
01:30:35,283 --> 01:30:40,241
Somehow, we made sure the
stock reached Chennai safely brother.

1147
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:45,950
Have delivered the stock to Chennai?

1148
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,825
Who told you to do that?

1149
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:52,450
No Brother.
The twenty-five lakhs you give is not enough.

1150
01:30:52,491 --> 01:30:54,741
If you give one crore per ton,
I will sell to you only.

1151
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:56,908
Hey Pushpa!
What is it bro?

1152
01:30:57,616 --> 01:30:58,783
If I say I no…

1153
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:02,366
Whom did he say he will sell brother?

1154
01:31:02,616 --> 01:31:03,908
Chennai Murugan.

1155
01:31:04,033 --> 01:31:05,491
I will sell it to him only,

1156
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:06,616
if you don't need it.

1157
01:31:06,741 --> 01:31:07,950
Hey, do you understand what you are asking?

1158
01:31:08,325 --> 01:31:09,991
We just cut his neck for asking fifty lakhs only.

1159
01:31:10,116 --> 01:31:12,700
And here you are asking for one crore.
Don’t you see what just happened.. ?

1160
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:13,741
I understand man.

1161
01:31:13,908 --> 01:31:15,991
I came here to ask fifty lakhs only.

1162
01:31:16,366 --> 01:31:19,116
But after seeing him, I understood
how high the risk is..

1163
01:31:19,158 --> 01:31:21,575
that’s why I am asking for a crore...
Am I right brother?

1164
01:31:22,866 --> 01:31:25,408
Brother, Tell me weather you can one crore per ton.

1165
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:27,950
Otherwise, I will sell to Chennai Murugan.

1166
01:31:34,116 --> 01:31:36,658
All of you think about it and call me.

1167
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,033
Okay?
I take leave brother.

1168
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:44,616
Oh! What is this bro?

1169
01:31:44,616 --> 01:31:49,366
This is black for sure.
Don’t worry and get it applied.

1170
01:32:06,325 --> 01:32:08,033
Brother, shall I kill him too?

1171
01:32:09,241 --> 01:32:12,491
You are back to senses now,
were you afraid when he was here?

1172
01:32:12,866 --> 01:32:15,991
I was in shock that he was speaking like that
even after seeing what death looks like.

1173
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:19,825
The amount of shock you had,

1174
01:32:20,908 --> 01:32:22,700
I had more than that.

1175
01:32:23,908 --> 01:32:25,950
We have left him unnecessarily bro.
We should have killed him.

1176
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:27,200
What do you say?

1177
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,116
Yes, Brother

1178
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:54,866
Brother, Can I make a call?

1179
01:33:04,825 --> 01:33:05,741
Brother…Murugan.

1180
01:33:05,908 --> 01:33:06,700
Greetings Bro.

1181
01:33:07,408 --> 01:33:10,075
This is syndicate member Pushpa speaking.

1182
01:33:12,158 --> 01:33:15,366
This time we don’t want to sell stock to Srinu bro.

1183
01:33:17,283 --> 01:33:19,033
Will you buy the goods directly?

1184
01:33:20,033 --> 01:33:22,158
Ok… Ok Brother.

1185
01:33:22,366 --> 01:33:24,533
Stock has already reached Chennai Sir.

1186
01:33:26,325 --> 01:33:30,116
I will come to Chennai tomorrow and discuss rate with you.

1187
01:33:30,116 --> 01:33:33,200
Ok. Write down my pager number brother.

1188
01:33:34,116 --> 01:33:36,991
Eight Three…Eight four.

1189
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:32,783
You fool!

1190
01:34:33,658 --> 01:34:35,991
I didn't leave as your brother in law spared me

1191
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:39,658
I left because I decided to leave.

1192
01:34:40,033 --> 01:34:40,950
What?

1193
01:34:41,741 --> 01:34:45,908
You thought Pushpa means flower...
Not a flower!

1194
01:34:47,283 --> 01:34:48,408
Fire!

1195
01:35:14,491 --> 01:35:16,533
Who are you?
What do you want?

1196
01:35:16,533 --> 01:35:17,991
We have come to meet Murugan.

1197
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:18,575
Is it?

1198
01:35:18,575 --> 01:35:20,325
Hey Surya… who are they?

1199
01:35:20,575 --> 01:35:22,783
Pushpa, Syndicate member.

1200
01:35:23,075 --> 01:35:25,700
Came from Tirupati to discuss business with Murugan bro.

1201
01:35:25,908 --> 01:35:28,825
Hey, say Pager No. 8384.

1202
01:35:28,825 --> 01:35:29,991
He will recognize us with that

1203
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:31,283
Why are you shouting in my ear?

1204
01:35:31,283 --> 01:35:35,241
Hey, Murugan Sir is busy and
he said he can’t meet anyone.

1205
01:35:35,408 --> 01:35:36,325
You heard it right!

1206
01:35:36,658 --> 01:35:39,200
Murugan Sir won’t meet anyone. Leave now

1207
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,866
Let him say that after seeing this piece.

1208
01:35:43,325 --> 01:35:44,075
What is this?

1209
01:35:44,366 --> 01:35:47,908
This is Bro’s visiting card.
He will understand if he looks at it

1210
01:35:56,533 --> 01:35:58,158
Its almost 07:00 PM

1211
01:35:58,158 --> 01:35:59,741
It's tea time for Murugan sir.

1212
01:35:59,741 --> 01:36:01,200
Quickly go and give a tea to Murugan sir.
-Ok sir

1213
01:36:01,741 --> 01:36:05,241
Hey, Tea won’t go anywhere.

1214
01:36:05,241 --> 01:36:07,658
Murugan himself will come to your shop today

1215
01:36:15,158 --> 01:36:16,200
A grade stock.

1216
01:36:17,283 --> 01:36:18,116
What is this man?

1217
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:21,616
I had seen it long back when I started the business.

1218
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,116
I’m seeing it again now.

1219
01:36:24,908 --> 01:36:25,991
This is gold.

1220
01:36:25,991 --> 01:36:28,700
How many hills we have to climb up
to see lord Venkateswara...

1221
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:31,741
Likewise that many hills you need
to climb down to find good sandalwood

1222
01:36:31,741 --> 01:36:33,950
This is found only in dense forests.

1223
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:38,116
Only Pushpa bro has the guts to get to that.

1224
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:22,700
Two tons…five trucks
We have ten tons of stock

1225
01:37:22,908 --> 01:37:23,950
Super man!

1226
01:37:25,533 --> 01:37:29,075
Will speak to Mangal Srinu
and fix the rate. You leave.

1227
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:32,616
Brother, We have decided not to sell
the stock to Mangal Srinu.

1228
01:37:33,325 --> 01:37:35,533
That is why we came directly to sell it to you.

1229
01:37:35,658 --> 01:37:37,533
That’s why we brought it this far.

1230
01:37:37,741 --> 01:37:39,033
Do you want stock or not?

1231
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:48,158
Hey, close the door.

1232
01:37:48,283 --> 01:37:49,741
Start the vehicles...
-Bro.. bro...

1233
01:37:50,116 --> 01:37:53,616
Mangal Srinu is very dangerous.

1234
01:37:54,366 --> 01:37:57,366
Can you do business defying him?

1235
01:38:00,408 --> 01:38:03,158
To hell with Srinu. Will you buy or not?

1236
01:38:03,158 --> 01:38:05,991
Any who came here defying Mangal Srinu
and they are all dead.

1237
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:09,283
Brother, many would have come to you.

1238
01:38:09,741 --> 01:38:13,741
I called you from Mangal Srinu’s place only and
told you that I am coming to you

1239
01:38:14,366 --> 01:38:15,408
I’m different bro.

1240
01:38:15,533 --> 01:38:17,408
You scream coming to me?

1241
01:38:18,366 --> 01:38:21,241
Do you know to whom you are talking to?
How did you get my number?

1242
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:22,950
I am Kondareddy’s partner.

1243
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,158
Konda Reddy himself sent me here to talk to you.

1244
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:29,741
Are you Kondareddy’s man?
You should've said this first.

1245
01:38:30,533 --> 01:38:32,200
Call him from my phone.

1246
01:38:32,241 --> 01:38:33,241
Give my phone.
-Here, bro.

1247
01:38:36,866 --> 01:38:40,825
Let's first negotiate the price..

1248
01:38:41,408 --> 01:38:42,658
You can call after that.

1249
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:45,158
Hello!

1250
01:38:45,325 --> 01:38:46,408
Brother Kondareeddy

1251
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,866
Hey Pushpa. Didn’t see you for the last 2 days.

1252
01:38:49,075 --> 01:38:49,908
Where did you go?

1253
01:38:50,116 --> 01:38:51,283
I came to Chennai?

1254
01:38:51,575 --> 01:38:53,991
Chennai? Why??

1255
01:38:54,241 --> 01:38:56,075
I came here to meet Murugan.

1256
01:38:56,283 --> 01:38:57,408
To meet Murugan?

1257
01:38:57,825 --> 01:39:00,158
Hey Jakka.
He says he went to meet Murugan

1258
01:39:02,366 --> 01:39:03,575
Whose permission did you take to go to Murugan?

1259
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,325
I asked you to go and meet Mangal Srinu, right?

1260
01:39:05,658 --> 01:39:08,450
What bro? Doesn’t Kondareddy know
that we came here?

1261
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:10,658
You wait, I am talking to him, right?

1262
01:39:11,408 --> 01:39:15,575
Just because we gave 4% share,
you want to act as you wish?

1263
01:39:16,866 --> 01:39:18,033
One and half crore…

1264
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:27,366
One and half crore per ton.

1265
01:39:27,491 --> 01:39:29,408
I just negotiated the deal with Murugan.

1266
01:39:29,908 --> 01:39:33,033
As usual, do you want me to sell to
Mangal Srinu for twenty-five lakhs

1267
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,950
or take risk and sell it to Murugan for one and half crore…

1268
01:39:40,491 --> 01:39:41,991
I won't proceed without your go ahead, bro.

1269
01:39:42,866 --> 01:39:49,991
But if you say no, I'll come to you
with this entire stock.

1270
01:39:50,033 --> 01:39:51,575
We'll not get this golden chance again, bro.

1271
01:39:52,283 --> 01:39:54,825
What do you think about Konda Reddy?

1272
01:39:55,116 --> 01:39:57,533
I stopped because I was bound by Syndicate’s decision.

1273
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:02,075
When we know that Mangal Srinu is
cheating us, who cares for the syndicate?

1274
01:40:02,283 --> 01:40:03,658
Finalize the deal.

1275
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:08,825
Brother...

1276
01:40:09,241 --> 01:40:15,408
50% share to me and 50% to you from the profits.
You remember we agreed on this the other day.

1277
01:40:24,741 --> 01:40:26,908
How dare you information to police
about us.. you idiot?

1278
01:40:33,908 --> 01:40:37,033
You bloody spies!
They informed the Police, bro.

1279
01:40:43,075 --> 01:40:44,616
I don’t have anything to do with it.. boss.

1280
01:40:45,033 --> 01:40:46,450
He did everything.

1281
01:40:47,075 --> 01:40:48,866
You knew, that he was doing all this.

1282
01:40:53,116 --> 01:40:54,158
I know, brother.

1283
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:55,241
Why didn’t you not inform us?

1284
01:40:57,741 --> 01:41:01,033
He lured me with money.

1285
01:41:02,283 --> 01:41:05,033
I got greedy in the hope to perform my daughter’s marriage.

1286
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:06,908
Is it?

1287
01:41:07,408 --> 01:41:08,491
Who is that?

1288
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:10,575
How did I not eye on her so far?

1289
01:41:11,033 --> 01:41:14,283
same one brother, that brown sari girl
you liked at the cinema hall.

1290
01:41:14,658 --> 01:41:16,866
Is she, his daughter?

1291
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:20,616
Isn’t she beautiful? I saw her from far.

1292
01:41:20,616 --> 01:41:23,283
You eyed, means should be beautiful.

1293
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:27,575
Then ask her to come once.
We shall talk to her

1294
01:41:31,491 --> 01:41:32,491
Lay him down here.

1295
01:41:33,908 --> 01:41:36,158
Rey, You guys go and get his parents

1296
01:41:36,908 --> 01:41:37,408
My...

1297
01:41:37,741 --> 01:41:38,575
Where is my father?

1298
01:41:39,075 --> 01:41:40,366
What happened to him.

1299
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,283
I’m asking you.

1300
01:41:42,408 --> 01:41:43,575
What happened to my father?

1301
01:41:43,783 --> 01:41:44,575
Tell me.

1302
01:41:45,075 --> 01:41:45,908
What happened to my father?

1303
01:41:48,241 --> 01:41:51,741
Rey Charan, you said she is just ok.

1304
01:41:52,741 --> 01:41:55,491
But she is looking superb like a film heroine.

1305
01:41:56,491 --> 01:41:58,116
Your father is alive.

1306
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:03,408
But go home and have a bath with scented soap,
apply perfume,

1307
01:42:03,866 --> 01:42:09,116
wear this saree with jasmine flowers
and come here in the night.

1308
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:11,075
Then, You can take your father home in the morning.

1309
01:42:11,783 --> 01:42:14,158
This is such a good news, why are you crying?

1310
01:42:15,033 --> 01:42:18,908
What? Can’t you adjust for one night
for the sake of your father’s life?

1311
01:42:26,116 --> 01:42:27,533
Go…Go.

1312
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:43,908
Hey!

1313
01:43:44,116 --> 01:43:44,616
Bro!

1314
01:43:45,033 --> 01:43:48,533
Go out and have some beer and biryani.
Come back in the morning.

1315
01:43:48,575 --> 01:43:49,283
Ok bro.

1316
01:43:49,408 --> 01:43:52,283
Rey, we can do this in the morning.
Let’s go. Rey. Let’s go

1317
01:44:17,908 --> 01:44:19,408
How come you came here dear?

1318
01:44:20,866 --> 01:44:22,283
Have you lost your way?

1319
01:44:22,283 --> 01:44:24,741
Jali threatened that he will kill my father

1320
01:44:25,616 --> 01:44:28,616
Why Jali?
Even I would kill him.

1321
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,783
How could your father
show loyalty to the Police?

1322
01:44:32,033 --> 01:44:35,825
He said he will spare him,
if I sleep with him tonight.

1323
01:44:41,866 --> 01:44:43,325
You came all decked up right.

1324
01:44:43,866 --> 01:44:46,700
Go there.
Did you come here for my permisson?

1325
01:44:49,325 --> 01:44:53,783
If I go there tonight, my father might
return home in the morning...

1326
01:44:54,616 --> 01:44:56,075
but I will not be able to come to your house ever.

1327
01:44:56,491 --> 01:44:58,950
Why do you want to come to the house of
a guy who doesn’t have surname?

1328
01:44:59,533 --> 01:45:01,450
You must have felt happy on the day the relation broke.

1329
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:04,075
You must have felt very happy
that you have gotten rid of me,

1330
01:45:04,075 --> 01:45:05,533
and you don’t need to see my face ever again.

1331
01:45:06,616 --> 01:45:08,075
Is this what you understood?

1332
01:45:09,283 --> 01:45:10,991
You are like this, from the beginning.

1333
01:45:11,325 --> 01:45:14,533
When did you ever understood the heart
of a girl that you can understand today.

1334
01:45:16,616 --> 01:45:20,658
When my friends told me that you are feeling sad,
because I was not looking at you,

1335
01:45:21,283 --> 01:45:25,450
I felt very happy that this boy likes me so much.

1336
01:45:26,616 --> 01:45:28,075
I liked you as soon as I saw you.

1337
01:45:32,783 --> 01:45:34,658
When you gave me money and asked for a kiss...

1338
01:45:34,866 --> 01:45:39,616
I thought this is your way of expressing love.

1339
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:45,075
When I said that I want to give first kiss to my husband,

1340
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:50,575
I gave an indication to you to marry me.

1341
01:45:51,533 --> 01:45:53,200
You didn't understand even that.

1342
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:56,825
My father doesn’t even start the lorry without my nod.

1343
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:00,908
Do you think you could come to my house
for marriage proposal without my wish?

1344
01:46:02,408 --> 01:46:08,991
Do you know how bad I felt seeing
you anxious when mother-in-law got hurt?

1345
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,866
You could have understood that,
had you seen into my eyes once.

1346
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:14,658
You left even without looking at me.

1347
01:46:14,783 --> 01:46:18,075
Do you mean to say, that I should
change my heart after hearing whatever you said...

1348
01:46:18,075 --> 01:46:20,533
and go fight with jaali Reddy and save your father?

1349
01:46:21,366 --> 01:46:22,866
It is not going to happen.
Leave now

1350
01:46:22,866 --> 01:46:25,491
I know that you won’t do anything like that.

1351
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:28,366
Your money and business are important to you, Isn’t it?

1352
01:46:28,741 --> 01:46:32,283
Why will you fight for a stranger like me?

1353
01:46:34,325 --> 01:46:37,158
Anyways, I didn’t come for that.

1354
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,200
Then why did you come?

1355
01:46:46,908 --> 01:46:55,450
I always wanted to share my first kiss and my first night
with someone whom I consider my husband.

1356
01:47:00,491 --> 01:47:02,658
Please sleep with me once.

1357
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:06,033
You will never see me again.

1358
01:47:08,116 --> 01:47:09,283
I will go.

1359
01:47:11,075 --> 01:47:13,200
And after that I don’t care what happens to my life.

1360
01:47:18,741 --> 01:47:19,700
What is this dear?

1361
01:47:21,325 --> 01:47:23,241
Do you love me so much?

1362
01:47:25,783 --> 01:47:29,366
You think I will allow anyone to lay his hand
on you after what you said.

1363
01:47:31,658 --> 01:47:33,241
Whoever it is..

1364
01:47:37,116 --> 01:47:39,700
will not allow

1365
01:47:48,366 --> 01:47:49,575
What Pushpa?

1366
01:47:50,783 --> 01:47:53,491
You only brought the girl to make
her sleep with me for just 4 percent?

1367
01:47:54,366 --> 01:47:56,700
I'll not give any percentage in this to you.

1368
01:49:42,283 --> 01:49:46,075
Are you firing on a girl?
I'll break you down today, rascal.

1369
01:49:47,241 --> 01:49:48,116
Dear, Come here.

1370
01:49:48,575 --> 01:49:49,825
Are you firing bullets on my girl?

1371
01:49:50,116 --> 01:49:51,825
I am going to kill you, idiot.

1372
01:50:11,825 --> 01:50:14,616
How dare you lay a hand on my to be wife?

1373
01:50:19,991 --> 01:50:20,741
Hey old man!

1374
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,950
Old man, get up!

1375
01:50:35,908 --> 01:50:39,658
Look Srivalli, your father is fine.
I made him lie down in the car.

1376
01:50:40,283 --> 01:50:44,741
What is this man?
You have hit Jali bro so badly.

1377
01:50:45,033 --> 01:50:48,116
Hey Jali bro. I feel pity looking at you.

1378
01:50:48,866 --> 01:50:51,658
What bro?
You made him incapable for anything.

1379
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:55,158
If Kondareddy gets to know if this, he will kill you bro.

1380
01:50:55,533 --> 01:50:58,575
Hey, who will tell?
This fellow only should say if at all…

1381
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:02,200
What man? What will you tell your brother?

1382
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:07,283
Will you go cry before him and
tell him shamelessly that Pushpa beat you.

1383
01:51:07,366 --> 01:51:11,700
Ey Jaali, Go and complain.
I don’t care.

1384
01:51:11,783 --> 01:51:13,533
Dear, come let’s go.

1385
01:51:13,616 --> 01:51:16,158
We will get it resolved either this way or that way.
I’m ready for whatever happens.

1386
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:21,450
Pushpa, I’m not an idiot to go
and complain to my brothers.

1387
01:51:23,408 --> 01:51:25,825
This is between you and me…

1388
01:51:27,575 --> 01:51:30,700
and I will deal about this with you directly.

1389
01:51:31,908 --> 01:51:33,408
I won’t leave you.

1390
01:51:33,408 --> 01:51:37,283
This.. This ..This ..
This is what is called as being a man.

1391
01:51:37,283 --> 01:51:42,491
What you did with women
all these days is not like a man.

1392
01:51:43,033 --> 01:51:45,616
Now you have proven that you are a man.

1393
01:51:45,783 --> 01:51:47,408
Now stand on your word.

1394
01:51:47,658 --> 01:51:50,741
Get well and return back.

1395
01:51:51,116 --> 01:51:52,908
Then fulfill your challenge.

1396
01:51:53,408 --> 01:51:55,825
What dear? What do you think?

1397
01:51:55,825 --> 01:51:57,450
I too believe the same

1398
01:51:57,658 --> 01:51:59,033
He will stand on his word right

1399
01:51:59,033 --> 01:52:01,158
How will he stand,
when you have already broken everything.

1400
01:52:12,158 --> 01:52:14,825
Careful, Come... come.

1401
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:19,575
Bro, I will park the car at home and come.

1402
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:34,116
I will take leave.

1403
01:52:34,116 --> 01:52:34,950
Pushpa!

1404
01:52:35,450 --> 01:52:37,283
Come and have dinner.

1405
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:38,741
No need Aunty.

1406
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:43,033
My mom is waiting for me... I have to go.

1407
01:52:43,075 --> 01:52:44,491
Pushpa, wait a minute.

1408
01:52:44,825 --> 01:52:45,700
You come.

1409
01:52:56,491 --> 01:52:57,700
My mom gave this food for you.

1410
01:53:00,158 --> 01:53:01,033
Okay.

1411
01:53:02,741 --> 01:53:03,491
You go.

1412
01:53:07,991 --> 01:53:09,450
Will you feed me now or what?

1413
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:10,283
Go.

1414
01:53:13,450 --> 01:53:14,366
What?

1415
01:53:23,158 --> 01:53:26,700
When you call me Dear… Dear,
I feel like I have become your wife

1416
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:29,616
Darling… My Darling

1417
01:53:30,116 --> 01:53:33,658
When I call you Darling… Darling,
you suit well as my Husband

1418
01:53:33,658 --> 01:53:36,575
Darling… My Darling

1419
01:53:36,866 --> 01:53:39,533
When I walk behind you

1420
01:53:40,283 --> 01:53:42,200
When I walk behind you

1421
01:53:42,241 --> 01:53:44,950
It feels like going uphill
to Venkanna Temple, Darling

1422
01:53:45,408 --> 01:53:47,408
When I sit next to you

1423
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:50,366
I feel like Goddess beside Lord Parameshwara.

1424
01:53:50,616 --> 01:53:54,158
Your path leads me towards love city

1425
01:53:54,158 --> 01:53:57,075
Darling… My Darling

1426
01:53:57,366 --> 01:54:00,200
My Darling…. Come here Darling

1427
01:54:00,616 --> 01:54:03,950
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1428
01:54:04,075 --> 01:54:06,866
My Darling… Come here Darling

1429
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:10,783
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1430
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:31,450
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1431
01:54:32,325 --> 01:54:35,616
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1432
01:54:35,616 --> 01:54:37,991
My breath gets stopped Darling

1433
01:54:38,908 --> 01:54:42,450
When you are chewing a Jarda Pan

1434
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:45,366
My body gets painted Red… Darling

1435
01:54:45,408 --> 01:54:48,158
When I hear your yells and roars…

1436
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:59,075
When I hear your yells and roars…
It thrills me like hell…

1437
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:02,575
When you sit cross legged, it mesmerizes me.

1438
01:55:02,575 --> 01:55:06,241
When you come closer to me,
my heart goes out of control

1439
01:55:06,241 --> 01:55:09,366
My Darling… my Darling

1440
01:55:09,408 --> 01:55:12,200
My Darling… Come here Darling

1441
01:55:12,616 --> 01:55:15,950
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1442
01:55:16,033 --> 01:55:18,825
My Darling… Come here Darling

1443
01:55:19,241 --> 01:55:22,575
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1444
01:55:37,366 --> 01:55:42,533
When I wear a new saree and you don’t complement

1445
01:55:44,033 --> 01:55:47,616
When I wear a new saree and you don’t complement

1446
01:55:47,658 --> 01:55:50,158
Wouldn’t that saree value become zero, Darling...

1447
01:55:50,908 --> 01:55:54,575
When I wear flowers in my hair
And if you don’t smell them

1448
01:55:54,575 --> 01:55:57,158
Wouldn’t the flower mound fall down.

1449
01:55:57,533 --> 01:56:00,741
When my saree frill slips down

1450
01:56:07,616 --> 01:56:11,075
When my saree frill slips down,
and you won’t look at me

1451
01:56:11,075 --> 01:56:14,533
The naughty wind would sympathize with me, Darling

1452
01:56:14,575 --> 01:56:18,366
If my beauty doesn’t become yours,
my life as girl is a waste

1453
01:56:18,366 --> 01:56:21,325
Darling…my Darling

1454
01:56:21,325 --> 01:56:24,116
My Darling… Come here Darling

1455
01:56:24,533 --> 01:56:27,866
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1456
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:30,741
My Darling… Come here Darling

1457
01:56:31,158 --> 01:56:34,491
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1458
01:56:45,366 --> 01:56:47,575
Bro, Operation to the spine it seems.

1459
01:56:47,741 --> 01:56:50,825
Doctor is saying only after that
he can say if he can walk or not

1460
01:56:55,241 --> 01:56:57,075
He won’t say who hit him.

1461
01:56:57,616 --> 01:56:58,866
And you people don’t know.

1462
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:00,366
Is that right?

1463
01:57:00,575 --> 01:57:01,408
Yes Brother.

1464
01:57:06,783 --> 01:57:08,283
Bro… Bro… Bro

1465
01:57:08,283 --> 01:57:10,033
Whom did he sleep with last night?

1466
01:57:10,033 --> 01:57:12,575
I don't know, boss!

1467
01:57:12,575 --> 01:57:17,075
She came in the night and
went back in the morning with her father.

1468
01:57:17,075 --> 01:57:19,075
Then, who did this to Jali?

1469
01:57:28,741 --> 01:57:32,158
Bro, looks like Kondareddy wants to kill the guy
who thrashed Jalreddy,

1470
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:35,158
once he gets to know who did it.. ignoring that,
you are looking at Pager and money.

1471
01:57:35,783 --> 01:57:39,200
How will he know? For the trashing I gave him,
He should not get up for one year.

1472
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:41,950
I think I haven’t given him enough.. .

1473
01:57:42,616 --> 01:57:46,075
Bro, Jali still has some masculinity left in him.
That is why he didn’t name you.

1474
01:57:46,450 --> 01:57:48,200
What If Kondareddy gets to know this…

1475
01:57:48,283 --> 01:57:50,533
I lost my count..
How will Kondareddy get to know?

1476
01:57:52,491 --> 01:57:56,116
What Pushpa?
Has the stock reached Murugan?

1477
01:57:56,658 --> 01:57:59,158
Reached Bro. He sent the message too.
Just reached it seems

1478
01:57:59,241 --> 01:58:03,325
Ok. You should go to Tirupati tomorrow
and get the money.

1479
01:58:03,741 --> 01:58:06,700
That Hawala slip is with you, only right?
- It is safe with me.

1480
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:07,825
Be ready in the morning

1481
01:58:09,366 --> 01:58:10,658
what is that injury on your hand?

1482
01:58:10,866 --> 01:58:13,283
This… Our
- That… Got scratched when coming in car.

1483
01:58:14,325 --> 01:58:15,783
Be careful man. Ok…

1484
01:58:16,116 --> 01:58:17,241
What Subbareddy?
- Bro…

1485
01:58:17,241 --> 01:58:19,575
Did you get the jeep tyres changed?

1486
01:58:23,533 --> 01:58:27,283
Bro. Do you think he heard?
- No, He didn’t.

1487
01:58:27,533 --> 01:58:30,241
No Bro. I have a doubt that he must have heard..

1488
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:34,283
I will do one thing.
I will go out and close the door and wait there..

1489
01:58:34,283 --> 01:58:36,658
You speak something.
I will see if can hear it or not

1490
01:58:38,866 --> 01:58:40,533
Bro... Speak.. Speak

1491
01:58:49,366 --> 01:58:50,700
bro, I could not hear anything

1492
01:58:51,491 --> 01:58:52,866
I didn’t speak anything

1493
01:58:56,991 --> 01:58:59,741
What man… What is this?
- Mosquitos Bro

1494
01:58:59,783 --> 01:59:00,950
What?
- Mosquitos

1495
01:59:01,908 --> 01:59:04,283
Be careful man. Too many mosquitos here.
What if we get Dengue Fever?

1496
01:59:04,283 --> 01:59:08,825
I’m going to Tirupati on work…
Do you want anything?

1497
01:59:09,283 --> 01:59:11,283
Don’t you know what I want?

1498
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:13,741
Your hands look good.

1499
01:59:14,616 --> 01:59:16,408
Should I bring you nail polish?

1500
01:59:19,950 --> 01:59:22,408
What? Don’t you like nail polish

1501
01:59:23,825 --> 01:59:24,991
What do you want?

1502
01:59:26,283 --> 01:59:29,658
Say something, boot polish if not nail polish

1503
01:59:30,033 --> 01:59:31,450
What are you doing?

1504
01:59:32,366 --> 01:59:34,075
I am talking with you.

1505
01:59:34,533 --> 01:59:36,200
What are you doing now?

1506
01:59:36,658 --> 01:59:38,033
Looking at you

1507
01:59:38,741 --> 01:59:39,950
Where is your hand?

1508
01:59:40,116 --> 01:59:42,283
what?
- Where is your hand?

1509
01:59:43,575 --> 01:59:46,283
My hand on your hand, Isn't it?

1510
01:59:47,908 --> 01:59:50,450
Not that hand
I am talking about another hand.

1511
01:59:51,366 --> 01:59:53,283
It's over.. here, I removed it..

1512
01:59:53,575 --> 01:59:56,658
I didn’t realise it because I was busy talking on phone

1513
01:59:56,783 --> 01:59:58,741
You didn’t know, is it?
You didn’t know?

1514
01:59:58,866 --> 02:00:01,241
You didn’t know, is it?
- Hey... Why are you hitting me, dear?

1515
02:00:01,241 --> 02:00:04,991
Don’t to talk after doing
whatever you wanted to do.

1516
02:00:04,991 --> 02:00:06,700
All are waiting for me and I came to meet you.

1517
02:00:07,158 --> 02:00:10,491
I came here to see your face before
going for money collection.

1518
02:00:10,491 --> 02:00:12,241
Do you know how excitedly I came?What?

1519
02:00:12,783 --> 02:00:15,866
Did I come to get hit by you?
I'm hurt and I will go.

1520
02:00:16,033 --> 02:00:19,491
Stop Darling...
-I'll go...

1521
02:00:19,491 --> 02:00:20,533
This is all waste business.

1522
02:00:20,533 --> 02:00:22,200
Stop Darling
-I will leave

1523
02:00:22,283 --> 02:00:25,116
What Darling?
You only did it and now you are only getting angry.

1524
02:00:26,033 --> 02:00:29,700
Why did you hit me? Se… Again,
you are getting angry

1525
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:31,366
Hold it darling

1526
02:00:32,491 --> 02:00:35,200
No, you will again abuse me
- Hold it, Darling

1527
02:00:35,450 --> 02:00:38,033
No, Thanks
- Hold it, Darling

1528
02:00:40,616 --> 02:00:41,325
Happy now?

1529
02:00:44,158 --> 02:00:46,491
I will stay, you go dear… go dear…

1530
02:00:52,075 --> 02:00:54,200
Srivalli! Srivalli!

1531
02:00:55,033 --> 02:00:56,408
I'm leaving, mom is calling.

1532
02:00:56,658 --> 02:01:00,908
Hey. What are you doing dear?
Cover this and set the hair.

1533
02:01:02,033 --> 02:01:05,533
Go now, you should take care of these things.
Otherwise, people would make news of it.

1534
02:01:06,241 --> 02:01:07,200
Don;t say anyone about what we did.

1535
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:09,658
Ok, Darling. I know

1536
02:01:15,241 --> 02:01:17,908
what dear? Looks like a lot happened inside

1537
02:01:18,033 --> 02:01:18,783
Nothing.

1538
02:01:18,783 --> 02:01:21,366
Hey Srivalli.
Ask Pushpa to have tiffin and go.

1539
02:01:21,366 --> 02:01:23,866
He had tiffin aunty. He had it just now.

1540
02:01:24,116 --> 02:01:25,700
Can’t you see it?

1541
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:26,575
See you, mu current!

1542
02:01:26,908 --> 02:01:28,158
Careful Pushpa!

1543
02:01:28,950 --> 02:01:30,366
Careful Pushpa?

1544
02:01:37,991 --> 02:01:39,450
Someone is coming.

1545
02:01:39,908 --> 02:01:41,575
Pushpa come... please come.

1546
02:01:41,741 --> 02:01:43,658
Shetji, are you fine?

1547
02:01:44,825 --> 02:01:46,616
How are you?
-Fine sir.

1548
02:01:47,658 --> 02:01:48,658
How are you?

1549
02:01:48,783 --> 02:01:50,325
How are you, Pushpa?
-All good!

1550
02:02:28,116 --> 02:02:29,158
You go... I'll come.

1551
02:02:29,158 --> 02:02:30,700
Pushpa... Shall I show these chains?

1552
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:54,241
Pushpa, go to new godown.

1553
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:10,783
(Song Humming)

1554
02:03:19,908 --> 02:03:24,325
How did you hear what I was singing to myself?

1555
02:03:24,325 --> 02:03:27,616
Why can’t I hear?
You think we can’t hear whatever you guys speak inside?

1556
02:03:27,908 --> 02:03:34,866
Leave that. When you and Pushpa were talking of beating
Jali Rreddy, me and Konda bro heard from outside.

1557
02:03:35,033 --> 02:03:37,158
What did you say? Move aside.

1558
02:03:46,991 --> 02:03:48,408
Max Pager Services

1559
02:03:48,408 --> 02:03:51,991
I have to send a message urgently.

1560
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:53,200
Please tell me the number?

1561
02:04:40,866 --> 02:04:41,866
Get him up.

1562
02:04:44,408 --> 02:04:47,825
What man? Did you forget who we are?

1563
02:04:48,825 --> 02:04:52,283
Just because we gave you four percent share
and a seat next to us,

1564
02:04:52,283 --> 02:04:55,283
do you think we will remain silent
if you lay your hands on our brother?

1565
02:04:55,450 --> 02:04:58,033
I will kill you, idiot.

1566
02:04:58,783 --> 02:05:01,866
Hey. He has another hawala slip in his pocket.
Search for it.

1567
02:05:02,908 --> 02:05:05,200
Why are you laughing?

1568
02:05:05,658 --> 02:05:07,658
My brother is talking and
you are laughing at him.

1569
02:05:07,658 --> 02:05:09,241
Else what bro?

1570
02:05:09,825 --> 02:05:13,158
Are you killing me truly because of your
love for your brother...

1571
02:05:13,658 --> 02:05:20,200
or do you think if you kill me,
you can have all the money?

1572
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:22,450
Hey… Nothing is bigger than my brother.

1573
02:05:22,616 --> 02:05:25,991
It’s a nice joke bro.
Maybe this is the last joke I will hear.

1574
02:05:26,283 --> 02:05:29,741
What are you searching man?
I keep it in the fold of my hand sleeve right.

1575
02:05:29,783 --> 02:05:33,908
You are not like before, Konda bro.

1576
02:05:33,908 --> 02:05:35,866
You have become very commercial.

1577
02:05:35,908 --> 02:05:36,658
Yes Brother. It is the same slip.

1578
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:37,658
On which date do we get our money?

1579
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:40,616
New title for you. Commercial Kondareddy.
Tag line- Ready to loot partners

1580
02:05:41,825 --> 02:05:43,325
Hey, take him and throw him in the pit

1581
02:05:43,325 --> 02:05:46,908
I know brother, that these kind of businesses
will definitely see death some day.

1582
02:05:48,533 --> 02:05:55,408
If by mistake, Lord Venkateswara supports me
and saves me,

1583
02:05:55,408 --> 02:05:58,033
I will become a very big man for sure.

1584
02:05:58,033 --> 02:06:00,533
I will sit on the top.

1585
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:03,575
Yes. I can visualize my future.

1586
02:06:07,075 --> 02:06:10,325
Why delay?
Shoot him up.

1587
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:37,325
Cut the rope. Take the knife.

1588
02:09:48,908 --> 02:09:49,950
Quickly.

1589
02:09:54,116 --> 02:09:55,116
What are you doing, idiot?

1590
02:10:08,908 --> 02:10:11,991
Come on bro, let's leave.

1591
02:10:16,741 --> 02:10:17,616
Are you fine, bro?

1592
02:10:44,533 --> 02:10:45,408
Hold on guys..

1593
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:54,158
He is getting scared.. he is scared..

1594
02:11:01,866 --> 02:11:05,241
Bro, we found jakkareddy.

1595
02:11:05,325 --> 02:11:07,950
what are you waiting for? Kill him

1596
02:11:08,033 --> 02:11:08,950
I will cut his neck bro…

1597
02:11:09,075 --> 02:11:10,408
then what about that coolie?

1598
02:11:10,408 --> 02:11:13,533
You mean, that Pushpa?
Our men would have killed him by now bro…

1599
02:12:22,783 --> 02:12:25,033
What Jakkareddy?
What are you looking at me like that.

1600
02:12:25,241 --> 02:12:27,158
Is it because I came back?

1601
02:12:27,908 --> 02:12:30,075
You and I may have million things between us…

1602
02:12:30,241 --> 02:12:34,283
but when an outsider comes, you are my partner.
That’s it.

1603
02:13:22,158 --> 02:13:23,533
What man… why are you coming on to me like that.

1604
02:13:24,658 --> 02:13:27,366
If my brother-in-law comes to know of it
he won’t leave you..

1605
02:13:27,533 --> 02:13:28,866
Stay away from me.

1606
02:13:39,116 --> 02:13:41,075
Why are you taking out the gun? Will you kill me?

1607
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:42,616
You will dig your own grave.

1608
02:13:43,158 --> 02:13:44,241
Even all these will be dead.

1609
02:13:44,325 --> 02:13:47,866
True Pushpa, It will become a big mess if you touch him.

1610
02:13:48,158 --> 02:13:50,241
He said it right, he is clever.

1611
02:13:50,533 --> 02:13:52,158
Even I want to kill him Pushpa.

1612
02:13:55,241 --> 02:13:57,658
But no… Leave him.

1613
02:13:59,158 --> 02:14:00,491
I don't need new enemies now.

1614
02:14:01,075 --> 02:14:03,200
He is getting scared…
All are scared of brother in law.

1615
02:14:03,533 --> 02:14:05,575
Remember, you're dead if something happens to me.

1616
02:14:06,158 --> 02:14:08,075
See… here my brother-in-law himself is calling.

1617
02:14:09,950 --> 02:14:11,575
Get the phone, lift it.

1618
02:14:11,783 --> 02:14:13,533
Hey look, let me talk to him.

1619
02:14:18,533 --> 02:14:20,283
What man Mogileesu?

1620
02:14:20,491 --> 02:14:21,658
Hello, Srinu bro…

1621
02:14:22,366 --> 02:14:23,450
Pushpa!

1622
02:14:26,241 --> 02:14:28,950
Bro, they caught Mogileesu.

1623
02:14:31,866 --> 02:14:34,700
Look Pushpa. I'm giving you a good offer.

1624
02:14:34,866 --> 02:14:39,241
Let us do business together, be my partner.
I'll give the rate you ask.

1625
02:14:40,908 --> 02:14:44,158
We will discuss about the rest later.
Don't harm my brother in law.

1626
02:14:44,283 --> 02:14:47,283
Send Mogileesu back to my house.

1627
02:14:47,575 --> 02:14:48,283
Okay?

1628
02:14:48,741 --> 02:14:51,033
Areyrey… I just killed him bro.

1629
02:14:53,033 --> 02:14:56,033
You should have called me five minutes ego.

1630
02:14:57,450 --> 02:15:03,741
Life will not come back once it is gone.
It cannot come back.

1631
02:15:03,783 --> 02:15:04,533
Brother in law…

1632
02:15:18,408 --> 02:15:19,783
Why are you silent, bro?

1633
02:15:20,866 --> 02:15:22,575
Same what you think has happened.

1634
02:15:23,533 --> 02:15:26,658
I preached that day, I am not scared of anyone.

1635
02:15:27,408 --> 02:15:32,075
But you're still messing.
Heard the sound of bullet, right?

1636
02:15:32,991 --> 02:15:37,325
One more important advise.
Just keep this in your head.

1637
02:15:37,825 --> 02:15:40,825
I didn’t come here to mess with anyone

1638
02:15:41,658 --> 02:15:45,658
I came here to rule.
I won’t compromise.

1639
02:16:01,866 --> 02:16:02,741
Sit Pushpa!

1640
02:16:46,533 --> 02:16:49,283
Bro… That Mangal Srinu is coming.

1641
02:16:50,283 --> 02:16:53,741
He is coming here to die today.
Hey… Give me the gun

1642
02:16:54,116 --> 02:16:57,283
Hey Jakka .. you hang on,
I asked Mangal Srinu to come.

1643
02:16:57,325 --> 02:17:00,908
If you guys fight here, the entire department will be here,

1644
02:17:01,158 --> 02:17:02,783
and I will get everyone killed in an encounter.

1645
02:17:02,908 --> 02:17:04,700
So Let's settle the matter here …

1646
02:17:35,033 --> 02:17:37,658
I will leave if my brother-in-law’s body is given.

1647
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:40,200
You can go... but, sit first.

1648
02:17:43,783 --> 02:17:46,575
We were like brothers right.
Then What is this?

1649
02:17:46,658 --> 02:17:49,283
You should ask them all that.
It is they who have started all this.

1650
02:17:49,283 --> 02:17:51,741
What is it about starting?
It will not end till you are killed.

1651
02:17:51,783 --> 02:17:53,700
Hey Jakka. You stop …

1652
02:17:54,075 --> 02:17:56,658
Bro, first ask them why they sold stock to Murugan...

1653
02:17:56,658 --> 02:17:59,866
Yes Bro. They sold the stock to Murugan
without Srinu bro’s knowledge

1654
02:18:00,783 --> 02:18:04,491
Ray Jakka, shouldn’t everyone stick to the syndicate?

1655
02:18:04,533 --> 02:18:06,200
Why are you guys doing this?

1656
02:18:16,325 --> 02:18:18,908
How much is this?
- Three crores

1657
02:18:20,241 --> 02:18:21,866
How much? How much did you sell a ton for?

1658
02:18:25,325 --> 02:18:26,450
One and half crore.

1659
02:18:27,950 --> 02:18:29,116
They said 25 lakhs for ton?

1660
02:18:29,283 --> 02:18:32,366
What is this?
Is this true?

1661
02:18:32,366 --> 02:18:34,325
I will give all these calculations later

1662
02:18:34,991 --> 02:18:39,866
but what is this man? You not only killed by brother-in-law,
you are also complaining against me

1663
02:18:39,866 --> 02:18:45,325
Hey, I didn’t kill your brother-in-law.
I killed the person who killed Kondareddy Bro.

1664
02:18:46,116 --> 02:18:49,575
Do you think I will sit silently and watch
when someone attacks Jakkareddy bro with a knife?

1665
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:51,991
I shot him.

1666
02:18:52,075 --> 02:18:53,908
You hold on man
- Even I won’t leave.. I will also kill.

1667
02:18:53,908 --> 02:18:56,033
What bro? Looks like both brothers-in-law’s are alike ...
Do you think we are scared?

1668
02:18:56,116 --> 02:18:58,283
What, you will kill? that too in front me.

1669
02:18:59,116 --> 02:19:01,908
Why are you giving the gun?
What is this? Why are you silent?

1670
02:19:02,033 --> 02:19:07,450
I called him when he was about to kill
my brother-in-law. Still he killed him.

1671
02:19:07,616 --> 02:19:10,283
Maybe you also called five minutes late like me.

1672
02:19:11,825 --> 02:19:13,325
But anyways, both sides have lost right?

1673
02:19:14,241 --> 02:19:17,866
Hey, put that gun away and first explain the calculations.

1674
02:19:19,825 --> 02:19:22,616
Till now you said, 25 lakhs per ton.. right?

1675
02:19:23,033 --> 02:19:24,658
Then how did he get a crore and half now?

1676
02:19:25,033 --> 02:19:26,283
We also asked him the same Sir?

1677
02:19:26,283 --> 02:19:29,241
Had he answered this, we wouldn’t have gone to Murugan
and things wouldn’t have come to this

1678
02:19:29,366 --> 02:19:32,116
This big man has screwed all of us so badly

1679
02:19:32,950 --> 02:19:36,408
What bro Srinu? Why are you silent?
Why don’t you answer when MLA sir is asking you?

1680
02:19:36,533 --> 02:19:38,991
What is this? Should I explain accounts now?

1681
02:19:39,241 --> 02:19:41,200
Have you guys forgotten what all I did so far?

1682
02:19:41,366 --> 02:19:44,408
True Bro. Why are you asking
Srinu bro for accounts now?

1683
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:46,658
How many people did he manage…?

1684
02:19:46,658 --> 02:19:48,616
How many check-posts he managed?

1685
02:19:48,616 --> 02:19:50,575
Won’t you take all that into account?

1686
02:19:50,575 --> 02:19:53,658
Hello Sir. We are coming there only.

1687
02:19:54,075 --> 02:19:57,033
You are paying off the police.
We are also paying off the police.

1688
02:19:57,116 --> 02:20:00,033
All of you are giving commissions.
Above that, we are also giving commissions

1689
02:20:00,158 --> 02:20:06,783
we are also giving commissions to people
in Forest, revenue, ID,… how will it work out?

1690
02:20:07,116 --> 02:20:09,325
We, together should pay them once only.

1691
02:20:09,616 --> 02:20:11,866
Then see how much will we save?

1692
02:20:12,116 --> 02:20:13,950
Twenty-five percent more is saved.

1693
02:20:14,241 --> 02:20:15,658
Which we were wasting.

1694
02:20:16,783 --> 02:20:20,533
Just by bypassing Seenanna and going directly
to Murugan, he paid us one and half crore.

1695
02:20:20,825 --> 02:20:25,158
If we all unite and fix a rate,
he will pay two crores at least.

1696
02:20:25,241 --> 02:20:26,866
What? two crores??

1697
02:20:26,908 --> 02:20:29,200
Bro, the story doesn’t stop here ...

1698
02:20:29,283 --> 02:20:32,366
There is Chatterjee in Calcutta,
and who is that in Mumbai? Ya.. Singh,

1699
02:20:32,366 --> 02:20:35,450
then Agarwal in Delhi.
I kept more people like them, in line.

1700
02:20:36,241 --> 02:20:40,033
Bro, we have the kind of stock
that is not available anywhere in the world.

1701
02:20:40,033 --> 02:20:41,908
We have it only in the forest here.

1702
02:20:42,158 --> 02:20:44,158
The quality is no where else.

1703
02:20:44,283 --> 02:20:47,075
With that kind of stock we have,
why should we go and ask them.

1704
02:20:47,075 --> 02:20:50,241
We should demand and create competition
amongst the buyers in the market,

1705
02:20:50,241 --> 02:20:52,283
Then they will buy our stock standing in Queue.

1706
02:20:52,366 --> 02:20:55,075
We may get three crores per ton also.

1707
02:20:55,866 --> 02:21:00,075
If we go by that, our MLA sir may get
at least 20 crores as commission.

1708
02:21:04,033 --> 02:21:07,116
Yes, Pushpa said it correctly,

1709
02:21:08,075 --> 02:21:11,325
If we hand over the syndicate to a person like this,
our business will be good

1710
02:21:11,325 --> 02:21:14,950
It’s easy to speak sitting on the shore.

1711
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:17,325
You will know the depth when you get into the water.

1712
02:21:19,325 --> 02:21:21,575
Pushpa Come man.
Sit down and tell the whole thing to MLA sir...

1713
02:21:27,075 --> 02:21:29,116
Give me one chance, Sir.

1714
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:32,533
I will make sure that we see the
kind of profits that we have never seen.

1715
02:21:34,491 --> 02:21:35,866
What are you thinking Sir?

1716
02:21:36,408 --> 02:21:37,783
Are you thinking, where is my confidence is coming from?

1717
02:21:38,491 --> 02:21:40,950
None of the stock I have
transported so far was ever caught.

1718
02:21:41,533 --> 02:21:44,450
That is my capital.
Trust me, Sir.

1719
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:48,408
All of you are going with him just because
he sold two tons for more.

1720
02:21:48,866 --> 02:21:52,200
Two people are also dead in the last two months
since he has entered the business,

1721
02:21:53,325 --> 02:21:57,491
just think, how many more dead bodies
will we see In the coming days.

1722
02:21:58,325 --> 02:22:02,158
What bro? do you want to believe everything this
youngster said and put the business in his hands?

1723
02:22:02,158 --> 02:22:05,741
Bro, I am not totally convinced.
-If we trust him, we all will go bankrupt.

1724
02:22:05,825 --> 02:22:08,283
Yes bro, Even I’m getting doubts

1725
02:22:10,325 --> 02:22:12,783
Everything he did is right in front of our eyes,
can’t you all see it?

1726
02:22:14,658 --> 02:22:17,241
Pushpa will manage the syndicate
from now onwards.

1727
02:22:17,491 --> 02:22:20,491
Everyone should sell their stock to Pushpa only.

1728
02:22:25,908 --> 02:22:27,700
We will have an oath taking ceremony
in Mandir tomorrow.

1729
02:22:33,783 --> 02:22:35,283
Take this cash and keep it in the vehicle.

1730
02:22:43,408 --> 02:22:46,825
MLA Sir, If they give me my brother-in-law’s body,

1731
02:22:47,408 --> 02:22:48,825
I will do the final rites.

1732
02:22:49,158 --> 02:22:53,075
Bro, From the time you came in,
you are sitting on his body only.

1733
02:22:53,075 --> 02:22:55,450
You'll get his body safely if you get up.

1734
02:22:56,116 --> 02:22:58,491
Hey Selva, lift the body and send it.

1735
02:23:25,450 --> 02:23:28,033
This is my city... This is my home...

1736
02:23:28,366 --> 02:23:30,908
The piece of sky above my head is also mine

1737
02:23:36,408 --> 02:23:39,075
That wrong is mine... This right is mine.

1738
02:23:39,283 --> 02:23:41,950
The fire that burns the right and wrong is also me

1739
02:23:47,408 --> 02:23:52,283
The one who can defeat me is not yet born on the earth
Even If he is born, it would be me again

1740
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:57,783
There is only one who can grow beyond me
And that’s me, myself in the future

1741
02:23:58,366 --> 02:24:01,241
If I twirl, it’s my mustache
And I hold Axe in my hand…

1742
02:24:01,241 --> 02:24:04,116
Whatever I do is the war
And I never negotiate

1743
02:24:06,825 --> 02:24:09,241
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1744
02:24:12,158 --> 02:24:14,825
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1745
02:24:28,491 --> 02:24:30,158
Will throw you in the lake

1746
02:24:31,283 --> 02:24:32,991
And I return with a fish

1747
02:24:34,033 --> 02:24:35,741
Will stick you to a pole

1748
02:24:36,658 --> 02:24:38,575
And I hoist like a flag

1749
02:24:39,575 --> 02:24:42,200
Will bury you in the soil and make you disappear

1750
02:24:42,241 --> 02:24:46,616
I will be found again as an expensive ore

1751
02:24:48,033 --> 02:24:50,491
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1752
02:24:53,575 --> 02:24:56,033
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1753
02:24:58,866 --> 02:25:01,325
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1754
02:25:11,658 --> 02:25:12,825
Open it.

1755
02:25:46,575 --> 02:25:48,116
Why are you standing like a ghost?

1756
02:25:48,533 --> 02:25:50,908
It is not even 15 days since my brother died.

1757
02:25:51,283 --> 02:25:55,866
And you are sleeping like a log since then.
Don't you have any shame?

1758
02:25:56,491 --> 02:25:58,200
What should I do?

1759
02:25:58,866 --> 02:26:01,783
That Pushpa has grown too big,

1760
02:26:02,033 --> 02:26:03,866
and MLA has also become a minister.

1761
02:26:04,283 --> 02:26:07,866
We can’t do anything till the government changes ...
We can’t do anything..

1762
02:26:08,408 --> 02:26:13,366
Then you should have waited till the
government changed to send my brother to him.

1763
02:26:14,366 --> 02:26:18,700
Did I send him to get killed? I Sent him to kill ...

1764
02:26:19,033 --> 02:26:22,158
What should I do if he died because of his incapability?

1765
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:28,200
If so, you also couldn’t kill him ..
Then, why are you still alive?

1766
02:26:28,241 --> 02:26:29,283
What did you say?

1767
02:26:29,700 --> 02:26:32,325
Why are you still alive?

1768
02:26:37,616 --> 02:26:40,575
Hey... Kamesh...
Bittu...

1769
02:26:41,450 --> 02:26:43,866
What happened?
- Come on, take me to the hospital

1770
02:26:45,116 --> 02:26:46,616
Come back if you are alive

1771
02:26:46,616 --> 02:26:47,825
Come back if you are alive

1772
02:26:47,825 --> 02:26:49,950
We will together take revenge..

1773
02:26:49,950 --> 02:26:53,075
or else I will go alone and kill that Pushpa.

1774
02:26:53,075 --> 02:26:54,950
Who are you? Who are you?

1775
02:26:55,783 --> 02:26:57,658
I’m the iron I’m the iron

1776
02:26:57,991 --> 02:27:00,450
I will become a knife if I’m put under fire

1777
02:27:03,908 --> 02:27:05,783
Who are you? Who are you?

1778
02:27:06,533 --> 02:27:08,533
I’m the soil I’m the soil

1779
02:27:08,991 --> 02:27:11,616
I will become a brick if you crush me

1780
02:27:14,575 --> 02:27:16,866
Who are you? Who are you?

1781
02:27:17,616 --> 02:27:19,616
I’m like a mountain.

1782
02:27:50,408 --> 02:27:51,991
Puspa's wedding card!

1783
02:27:52,991 --> 02:27:54,450
This is not going to happen.

1784
02:27:55,116 --> 02:28:00,450
I will become the god if you hurt me.

1785
02:28:00,700 --> 02:28:03,241
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1786
02:28:06,325 --> 02:28:08,866
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1787
02:28:11,325 --> 02:28:13,866
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1788
02:28:16,741 --> 02:28:19,283
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1789
02:28:32,783 --> 02:28:36,658
With regret, Govindappa resigns and leaves,
claiming responsibility for Bhujanga's murder

1790
02:28:39,116 --> 02:28:45,616
Even though Jal Reddy wants take revenge badly,
he was not in a state to get up.

1791
02:28:45,616 --> 02:28:52,325
Burning with vengeance, Daksha was left helpless..

1792
02:28:52,408 --> 02:28:56,075
when everyone thought that no one can touch Pushpa.

1793
02:28:56,408 --> 02:29:05,116
The new person arrived. And the whole story changed.
He came from Haryana on transfer and was weak in Hindi.

1794
02:29:28,283 --> 02:29:29,825
SP... Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat

1795
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:33,158
He was a man, who could make even
the best dance on his signals.

1796
02:30:17,783 --> 02:30:18,908
It is strong

1797
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:21,158
Is it Sheelavathi or what?
- Yes sir ...

1798
02:30:22,366 --> 02:30:23,033
Come!

1799
02:30:35,741 --> 02:30:39,366
Nathulal Sir, Sheelavathi is strong

1800
02:30:39,741 --> 02:30:41,325
You get good quality here, Sir

1801
02:30:43,283 --> 02:30:45,158
That’s why I got asleep,

1802
02:30:49,075 --> 02:30:54,491
Was I about to sleep?
-No! -I'll sleep.

1803
02:30:55,533 --> 02:30:58,575
I’m falling asleep… I will sleep.

1804
02:31:14,033 --> 02:31:16,616
Did you give this to me?
- yes sir

1805
02:31:17,991 --> 02:31:20,408
What is your name?
- Mallesh sir.

1806
02:31:20,783 --> 02:31:22,575
What?
- Mallesh sir.

1807
02:31:48,241 --> 02:31:49,616
What is your name?

1808
02:31:51,158 --> 02:31:54,783
- De ... De ... Devaraj Sir ...

1809
02:31:57,033 --> 02:31:58,158
Devaraj Sir ...

1810
02:32:03,241 --> 02:32:05,700
Sir…Sir ... Sir ... SP sir ...

1811
02:32:06,116 --> 02:32:08,783
Heard, that you arrested 12 cannabis smugglers.
How,? Sir..

1812
02:32:09,033 --> 02:32:11,408
10 people, not 12 ...

1813
02:32:11,575 --> 02:32:13,908
two fled ...

1814
02:32:13,950 --> 02:32:15,575
They did not run away ...
they were killed.

1815
02:32:15,575 --> 02:32:16,366
Shut up!

1816
02:32:16,366 --> 02:32:18,033
Sir... sir... did you kill them?

1817
02:32:18,075 --> 02:32:22,950
Sir ... he says they were exactly 12 people ...
we also have the same information. Where are the other two?

1818
02:32:22,950 --> 02:32:24,741
Sir ... sir ... they were killed sir ... killed sir..

1819
02:32:24,783 --> 02:32:31,575
Didn’t I say that two of them have fled? He is a smuggler...
He doesn’t know the math. I will teach him now

1820
02:32:31,783 --> 02:32:34,158
Sir… what they are saying, is true?

1821
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:39,908
The new SP has come. I’m going to give him the card.
I will meet you once on the way.

1822
02:32:39,950 --> 02:32:41,866
Why do you want to meet?
I won't meet.

1823
02:32:42,158 --> 02:32:43,658
I just want to talk

1824
02:32:43,700 --> 02:32:46,241
Just talk?
Will you sit silently once you come?

1825
02:32:46,241 --> 02:32:47,991
A lot will happen after that

1826
02:32:48,366 --> 02:32:51,075
I just want to talk to you and leave.
I will just talk and leave

1827
02:32:51,158 --> 02:32:55,950
What? You will see and go is it,
as if I don’t know what you will do.

1828
02:32:57,408 --> 02:33:01,908
Have some patience. There's just
some time left for the marriage.

1829
02:33:01,991 --> 02:33:03,658
Dear, why are you objecting when I say that
I will meet you and once and leave?

1830
02:33:03,658 --> 02:33:04,616
Hey … Where are you going?

1831
02:33:04,616 --> 02:33:05,616
I am going to the tailor.

1832
02:33:05,825 --> 02:33:08,616
Hey… You should not go out of home.
It is a bad omen.

1833
02:33:08,616 --> 02:33:11,450
What if some evil sight falls on you?

1834
02:33:11,741 --> 02:33:13,991
What ... what is this old woman’s torture?

1835
02:33:13,991 --> 02:33:17,366
Dear… Listen to what I’m telling you ...
I don’t know why but my mind is suspecting harm.

1836
02:33:17,741 --> 02:33:20,366
Listen to me, son.
-No problem, mom.

1837
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:22,075
Hey Pushpa!

1838
02:33:23,491 --> 02:33:24,158
Pushpa.

1839
02:33:24,658 --> 02:33:25,366
Come...

1840
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:32,200
This is the First-time meeting with the newly appointed SP.

1841
02:33:32,616 --> 02:33:33,075
Sir...

1842
02:33:33,616 --> 02:33:34,658
I brought coffee

1843
02:33:34,658 --> 02:33:35,491
Will you put it on my head?

1844
02:33:35,866 --> 02:33:38,616
Had to bend to see him.

1845
02:33:45,825 --> 02:33:47,075
He is only Pushpa Sir.

1846
02:33:47,158 --> 02:33:48,241
I told you about.

1847
02:33:48,533 --> 02:33:50,825
He looks after the entire red sandal syndicate.

1848
02:33:51,366 --> 02:33:53,533
He came to see you, Sir.

1849
02:33:54,783 --> 02:33:57,741
Hello SP…What is your name?

1850
02:33:58,616 --> 02:34:02,908
Ban…var sing Skiva…skyavathaa

1851
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:04,325
whatever it is...

1852
02:34:05,533 --> 02:34:08,533
My marriage is on the 11th.

1853
02:34:08,616 --> 02:34:09,950
Please come and have the food.

1854
02:34:12,075 --> 02:34:14,741
Don;t get any box from home.

1855
02:34:17,575 --> 02:34:18,950
Here is one month commission…

1856
02:34:19,116 --> 02:34:20,033
One crore rupees.

1857
02:34:20,491 --> 02:34:22,825
Every month we will send you commission.

1858
02:35:24,866 --> 02:35:27,408
I felt short!

1859
02:35:30,241 --> 02:35:31,700
something is short

1860
02:35:32,366 --> 02:35:33,033
What?

1861
02:35:34,116 --> 02:35:35,575
I felt it is short!

1862
02:35:35,741 --> 02:35:37,991
No Sir, we counted it.

1863
02:35:44,158 --> 02:35:45,616
Don;t you understand?

1864
02:35:48,991 --> 02:35:49,950
Guys, count...

1865
02:35:54,616 --> 02:35:58,200
Shall I tell what is the difference
between thief and Police.

1866
02:35:58,616 --> 02:36:01,616
He wore a white shirt… I too wore a white shirt,

1867
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:05,741
The difference is, no label on his shirt.

1868
02:36:07,991 --> 02:36:10,866
But, my short has the label. Look…

1869
02:36:11,866 --> 02:36:12,741
Yes Sir…

1870
02:36:13,075 --> 02:36:14,200
That is a brand.

1871
02:36:16,116 --> 02:36:17,325
you know what brand is right

1872
02:36:17,325 --> 02:36:18,200
No Sir.

1873
02:36:19,325 --> 02:36:23,116
How to tell... Surname

1874
02:36:24,075 --> 02:36:24,825
No sir.

1875
02:36:25,825 --> 02:36:26,825
Family name

1876
02:36:26,825 --> 02:36:27,741
No Sir

1877
02:36:28,450 --> 02:36:29,408
Father's name

1878
02:36:29,700 --> 02:36:30,366
Yes sir.

1879
02:36:30,908 --> 02:36:32,783
It is like a surname from the one giving birth…

1880
02:36:34,241 --> 02:36:37,366
Brand name tells who manufactured this...

1881
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:41,200
The one manufacturing puts his stamp, right?.

1882
02:36:44,658 --> 02:36:47,866
Yor shirt has no stamp.
Thus..

1883
02:36:49,825 --> 02:36:51,033
You have no value.

1884
02:36:51,991 --> 02:36:55,950
So, you can never be a brand.

1885
02:36:58,033 --> 02:36:59,700
The count is right sir.

1886
02:37:00,950 --> 02:37:03,075
Something is short.

1887
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:10,658
A guy without any value,
can never see value of others.

1888
02:37:13,033 --> 02:37:14,741
Tell us how much money is short sir…

1889
02:37:14,741 --> 02:37:15,700
we will give

1890
02:37:16,033 --> 02:37:17,283
Mr. Nathulal

1891
02:37:18,741 --> 02:37:19,866
Bring the handcuffs.

1892
02:37:29,450 --> 02:37:32,866
If I arrest you now and charge you with PD act,

1893
02:37:33,283 --> 02:37:35,033
do you know how many years you will you be jailed?

1894
02:37:35,283 --> 02:37:36,116
Three years Sir.

1895
02:37:36,241 --> 02:37:37,158
Three years…

1896
02:37:37,491 --> 02:37:38,866
Your wedding on the 11th, right?

1897
02:37:38,991 --> 02:37:43,950
If you go to jail now, when will you get married?

1898
02:37:44,658 --> 02:37:46,908
After three years…

1899
02:37:47,116 --> 02:37:53,825
It means I will decide when you will get married.
Should I decide even for you? Give the key.

1900
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:59,366
If you are married now…

1901
02:38:00,325 --> 02:38:04,616
When will your wife become pregnant…

1902
02:38:05,283 --> 02:38:07,366
When will she get pregnant.

1903
02:38:08,783 --> 02:38:10,075
It'll take minimum one month.

1904
02:38:10,741 --> 02:38:12,408
He is a man…

1905
02:38:14,533 --> 02:38:17,575
If you go to jail, how'll you show the manliness?

1906
02:38:23,450 --> 02:38:25,366
you'll not be charged for smiling.

1907
02:38:26,450 --> 02:38:29,075
What? tightening fists?

1908
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:31,283
Getting angry?

1909
02:38:32,825 --> 02:38:33,658
open it… open it

1910
02:38:35,325 --> 02:38:37,950
You don’t have that much luxury with police…

1911
02:38:38,116 --> 02:38:40,533
Open your hands… Open them…

1912
02:38:41,658 --> 02:38:42,533
Open them…

1913
02:38:48,616 --> 02:38:49,491
Open them…

1914
02:38:51,325 --> 02:38:52,241
Shh!

1915
02:38:52,825 --> 02:38:54,533
Did you understand what was short?

1916
02:38:58,866 --> 02:39:00,241
Hey, you guys hold on.

1917
02:39:06,908 --> 02:39:09,741
Pushpa’s count never goes wrong.

1918
02:39:12,866 --> 02:39:15,366
Tell me what is short for you sir…

1919
02:39:16,366 --> 02:39:17,116
What?

1920
02:39:18,616 --> 02:39:21,533
How much more do you need, sir?

1921
02:39:30,158 --> 02:39:35,491
How much more do you need, sir?

1922
02:39:35,491 --> 02:39:36,366
Sir…

1923
02:39:38,575 --> 02:39:40,450
That was short.

1924
02:39:41,241 --> 02:39:50,741
I told you one short; one thing was short. The respect!
Sir! Sir was short.

1925
02:39:51,575 --> 02:39:54,075
I should attend the wedding, right?

1926
02:39:54,950 --> 02:39:59,408
You should say “please attend the wedding Sir”.

1927
02:40:03,325 --> 02:40:05,033
Lal Gopal …
-Sir…

1928
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:06,533
Uncuff him.

1929
02:40:09,783 --> 02:40:10,908
Now the count is correct.

1930
02:40:11,991 --> 02:40:13,158
Let the notes come.

1931
02:40:13,950 --> 02:40:18,366
From now on, along with the cash, sir also should come.

1932
02:40:20,325 --> 02:40:26,408
How much sir should take and
how much you will get will be decided by sir.

1933
02:40:26,908 --> 02:40:29,450
Shekhawat sir will decide.

1934
02:40:34,658 --> 02:40:35,575
Pushpa!

1935
02:40:40,616 --> 02:40:42,075
This is my gift for your wedding.

1936
02:40:43,491 --> 02:40:45,866
Buy clothes…branded ones.

1937
02:40:48,408 --> 02:40:49,616
I gave you a gift.

1938
02:40:51,325 --> 02:40:52,700
Won’t you give me a party, Pushpa?

1939
02:40:52,783 --> 02:40:53,991
Don’t know why?

1940
02:40:53,991 --> 02:40:57,700
Pushpa used to do whatever
Shekakavat said from then onwards.

1941
02:40:57,991 --> 02:41:01,366
He used to follow his orders religiously.

1942
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:04,283
Never seen Pushpa bend before anyone till then.

1943
02:41:04,283 --> 02:41:06,616
This is the first time he was doing so.

1944
02:41:06,825 --> 02:41:09,700
We used to wonder why he is behaving like that.

1945
02:41:09,741 --> 02:41:12,283
That day, a little before Pushpa’s wedding muhurtham,

1946
02:41:12,283 --> 02:41:14,283
Priest called for the bridegroom.

1947
02:41:14,450 --> 02:41:15,991
When we went in to call him,

1948
02:41:16,741 --> 02:41:19,616
Pushpa was not there.

1949
02:41:20,491 --> 02:41:21,950
Even his motorcycle was also not there.

1950
02:41:22,158 --> 02:41:27,950
Look sir ... I have got all the non veg items for you.

1951
02:41:31,866 --> 02:41:34,283
Wow!!… What is this Sir?

1952
02:41:36,908 --> 02:41:38,200
What is this Sir?

1953
02:41:38,450 --> 02:41:40,283
Never thought you have a funny side too, Sir.

1954
02:41:41,741 --> 02:41:46,283
Both Kishore Kumar and Michael Jackson
spirits posessed over you today.

1955
02:41:46,658 --> 02:41:51,575
But that day you scared me with a mask of a tiger.

1956
02:41:52,033 --> 02:41:53,658
Had to scare Pushpa.

1957
02:41:54,241 --> 02:41:57,783
Only then you came know how to behave with me.

1958
02:41:58,241 --> 02:42:01,700
See now we are drinking together happily.

1959
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:03,950
Where is Pushpa?

1960
02:42:03,950 --> 02:42:06,616
Auspicious time is nearing..
-I'm calling him.

1961
02:42:09,616 --> 02:42:12,241
Not able to connect. Calling him
-Call him again.

1962
02:42:13,575 --> 02:42:16,491
What Pushpa? Today is your wedding, right?

1963
02:42:17,158 --> 02:42:19,033
And why are drinking with me now?

1964
02:42:19,741 --> 02:42:20,741
Forget that!

1965
02:42:21,325 --> 02:42:26,575
What difference does it make, sir?
Will the bride run away if I go half an hour late.

1966
02:42:27,825 --> 02:42:35,325
But you Shekhawat Sir, gave me time to speak to you.

1967
02:42:36,408 --> 02:42:39,158
When you referred to the wedding,
I remembered one thing.

1968
02:42:39,366 --> 02:42:45,950
You said, you will decide when I get married,
and when do I have kids, right?

1969
02:42:47,241 --> 02:42:49,783
Why did you say that Sir?
I felt very bad.

1970
02:42:51,575 --> 02:42:54,033
You brought my wife to be, in between.

1971
02:42:54,616 --> 02:42:57,158
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

1972
02:42:57,575 --> 02:42:58,908
Past is past.

1973
02:42:59,825 --> 02:43:00,491
It’s ok sir.

1974
02:43:01,033 --> 02:43:03,658
You must have said that to hurt me.

1975
02:43:04,325 --> 02:43:05,533
That’s it, right sir? Leave it.

1976
02:43:06,783 --> 02:43:07,658
But...

1977
02:43:09,491 --> 02:43:15,783
I didn’t like the way you insulted my mother Sir

1978
02:43:16,241 --> 02:43:18,408
What did I say about your mother Pushpa?

1979
02:43:19,575 --> 02:43:24,283
You know that I don’t have a surname right, Sir?

1980
02:43:26,491 --> 02:43:30,408
In spite of that, you insulted me
by saying who manufactured me …

1981
02:43:30,408 --> 02:43:35,700
who gave birth.
Stamp, Stamp… this…that. Right Sir?

1982
02:43:36,533 --> 02:43:38,783
What is this Pushpa?
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

1983
02:43:39,491 --> 02:43:40,783
I already forgot the past.

1984
02:43:42,033 --> 02:43:47,283
When someone speaks about my surname,
my blood boils, sir.

1985
02:43:48,450 --> 02:43:50,658
And the day you insulted my birth...

1986
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:54,283
it was insulting my mother, sir.

1987
02:43:55,575 --> 02:44:00,658
Every Idiot insulted me with this
from the time I was born Sir.

1988
02:44:01,158 --> 02:44:01,950
Pushpa.

1989
02:44:02,783 --> 02:44:04,408
You are drunk and speaking nonsense.

1990
02:44:04,408 --> 02:44:05,741
You are tipsy?

1991
02:44:08,408 --> 02:44:11,283
I won't do drama.

1992
02:44:12,533 --> 02:44:13,991
Your gun has one extra bullet.

1993
02:44:14,075 --> 02:44:14,991
Extra bullet?

1994
02:44:15,825 --> 02:44:21,825
Like you, I don’t create suspense
like how you said short that day.

1995
02:44:22,408 --> 02:44:24,200
There is one extra bullet in your revolver.

1996
02:44:27,408 --> 02:44:28,075
In this?

1997
02:44:28,491 --> 02:44:29,325
Yes!

1998
02:44:29,575 --> 02:44:30,200
Give me!

1999
02:44:35,158 --> 02:44:37,575
There are six Sir…
Did you notice it? One is extra

2000
02:44:37,825 --> 02:44:39,450
That is Service revolver Pushpa.

2001
02:44:40,075 --> 02:44:41,783
It will have Six bullets only.

2002
02:44:42,908 --> 02:44:48,075
That day when I tightened my fists hearing your words,
you aimed this gun at me right, Sir.

2003
02:44:48,783 --> 02:44:51,908
The bullet that had to go into this remained in this only.

2004
02:44:52,075 --> 02:44:53,075
That one is extra in this.
-Have you gone mad?

2005
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:22,366
Do you know what this is Sir?

2006
02:45:24,241 --> 02:45:27,158
This is my father’s blood which is flowing in my body.

2007
02:45:28,825 --> 02:45:35,741
My father gave me this even before
my brothers could snatch the surname from me.

2008
02:45:37,825 --> 02:45:40,408
No one can separate this from me.

2009
02:45:41,283 --> 02:45:46,408
This is my brand, Sir…

2010
02:46:01,908 --> 02:46:03,991
Hey, Shekhawat sir… Idiot

2011
02:46:04,450 --> 02:46:08,158
What? did you think I am of a brand
that will get scared of bullet?

2012
02:46:08,950 --> 02:46:12,575
This brand has grown with its own attitude.

2013
02:46:13,658 --> 02:46:19,241
Do you know why Pushpa was silent
that day when you said all that?

2014
02:46:20,325 --> 02:46:22,075
My mother didn’t have any happy moments ever.

2015
02:46:23,075 --> 02:46:27,283
But she'll be very happy with my wedding.

2016
02:46:28,491 --> 02:46:32,783
I stopped myself till this hour,
thinking my mother will feel bad if anything happens.

2017
02:46:34,533 --> 02:46:37,116
Now I won’t hold myself back.

2018
02:46:37,158 --> 02:46:38,575
Greetings! Please come sir!
-Greetings!

2019
02:46:39,283 --> 02:46:40,533
Where is Pushpa?

2020
02:46:45,033 --> 02:46:47,616
He has a meeting with Shikhawat sir

2021
02:46:47,950 --> 02:46:51,908
You won;t be forgiven for this.

2022
02:46:51,991 --> 02:46:54,991
Shut up, you Government dog.

2023
02:46:55,825 --> 02:46:56,991
Strip your shirt.

2024
02:47:01,158 --> 02:47:03,575
Pushpa, do you know with
whom you are confronting ?

2025
02:47:05,116 --> 02:47:06,908
Bhanwar Singh.

2026
02:47:07,366 --> 02:47:09,658
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat

2027
02:47:09,991 --> 02:47:11,033
Is it?

2028
02:47:11,783 --> 02:47:13,241
Then remove your pants also

2029
02:47:13,533 --> 02:47:14,450
Why this?

2030
02:47:14,450 --> 02:47:20,950
Pushpa stripped Shekhawat sir’s clothes
and made him stand stark naked..

2031
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:23,366
imagine how great feels..

2032
02:47:24,700 --> 02:47:26,700
Take it off.

2033
02:47:58,158 --> 02:48:01,908
Did you understand now ? Everyone will feel
the same way when you strip them.

2034
02:48:02,533 --> 02:48:06,658
It can be Shekhawat Sir or Pushpa bro.

2035
02:48:07,825 --> 02:48:10,950
You don’t have clothes on your body.
I don’t have clothes on my body.

2036
02:48:10,950 --> 02:48:13,116
But there is one difference, do you know it?

2037
02:48:13,866 --> 02:48:16,450
Pushpa started his life like this.

2038
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:20,658
The journey of a coolie to King of the syndicate!

2039
02:48:25,991 --> 02:48:27,991
Only Pushpa can achieve that.

2040
02:48:28,325 --> 02:48:31,283
The range that was then is the same now.

2041
02:48:31,491 --> 02:48:34,908
See, If I go on the road like this also,
they will call me Pushpa bro.

2042
02:48:34,991 --> 02:48:39,075
If you go on the road like this without
a police uniform, Who will recognise you

2043
02:48:39,283 --> 02:48:42,241
not even your dog will respect you.

2044
02:48:44,158 --> 02:48:48,408
Brand is not in the clothes you wear.
It is in your character

2045
02:48:53,241 --> 02:48:54,700
Hey Shekhawat Sir...

2046
02:48:55,033 --> 02:48:56,783
please keep this in your mind

2047
02:48:57,866 --> 02:49:01,533
The load that has to go will go and the
money 'has to come will keep coming

2048
02:49:01,533 --> 02:49:03,158
You won’t get a rupee.

2049
02:49:03,950 --> 02:49:08,033
You will have just the uniform on your body
but none will respect that.

2050
02:49:08,825 --> 02:49:14,116
You will only have fake respect.
I will pull away everything else

2051
02:49:14,241 --> 02:49:15,825
See you.

2052
02:49:35,575 --> 02:49:40,033
(Sanskrit Sloka)

2053
02:50:21,116 --> 02:50:23,241
Sorry, Sir… It couldn't recognising you without uniform.

2054
02:50:23,533 --> 02:50:25,366
Hey, keep quiet.

2055
02:50:40,950 --> 02:50:42,158
What, dear?

2056
02:50:42,366 --> 02:50:44,408
Is everything fine?
What happened?

2057
02:50:44,491 --> 02:50:45,616
What happened?

2058
02:51:06,908 --> 02:51:09,908
Someone thought Pushpa means flower.

2059
02:51:14,033 --> 02:51:16,491
I made him understand Pushpa means fire.

2060
02:51:17,408 --> 02:51:19,825
Ok. It’s all over, right?

2061
02:51:20,575 --> 02:51:21,366
No!

2062
02:51:23,033 --> 02:51:24,991
Crossed the limits!

2063
02:51:25,283 --> 02:51:26,158
What happened sir?

2064
02:51:28,450 --> 02:51:29,741
Pushpa!

2065
02:51:34,616 --> 02:51:36,825
Whoever I may face...

2066
02:51:38,283 --> 02:51:40,366
I will never budge.
